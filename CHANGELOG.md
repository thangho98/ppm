# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Language servers in the editor** — real completions, hover types, go to definition, find references, rename, quick fixes, formatting, document symbols and inlay hints, from the same language server binaries VS Code drives. PPM's server hosts the language server processes and the browser talks a thin bridge to them, which is the seam VS Code puts between its renderer and its extension host. Ships support for TypeScript/JavaScript (including the `.tsx` and `.jsx` variants), Python, Go, Rust, C/C++, JSON, HTML, CSS/SCSS/LESS, YAML, Bash, PHP, Ruby, Lua, Vue and Svelte.
  - Nothing is installed for you. A missing server is reported in the editor toolbar with the one command that installs it, because an editor that fetches and runs a binary because you opened a file is doing something you did not ask for. A project that ships its own server in `node_modules/.bin` is preferred over a global one, the way VS Code's "Use Workspace Version" works.
  - One server process is shared by every tab on the same project root, and a monorepo package with its own `tsconfig.json` gets its own — that is a different root and a different set of types. A released server stays up for five minutes, because closing and reopening a tab is the commonest thing anyone does and a cold rust-analyzer start is expensive.
  - Monaco's built-in TypeScript validation stays off. It sees one file with no `tsconfig.json` and no `node_modules`, so it reports "Cannot find module" for every real import; the diagnostics now come from a server that can actually see the project.
  - **A Problems panel**, in the dock under the editor and opened from the error and warning counts at the left of the status bar — where VS Code puts both. Every diagnostic across the files you have open, grouped by file and ordered by position, with the rule that produced it (`ts(2322)`) and a click to jump to the line. On a phone, where there is no status bar, it opens from the row that already appears above the editor when something is wrong. It lists the files that are open, because that is what a language server has told us about — a file never opened has never been checked, and the empty state says so rather than implying the project is clean.
  - **Semantic highlighting** — a name is coloured by what it *is* rather than by what it looks like, so a class, a type parameter, a parameter and a read-only local are told apart where Monaco's regular expressions see four identifiers. The server's own legend is read from its initialize result and the provider registered against it, because a token is an index into that table: decoding with the wrong one does not fail, it colours the file confidently and wrongly.

- **Blame** (`@ppm/ext-git-graph` 0.3.0, `Mod+Shift+B`) — who last touched each line of a file, with an age heatmap down the gutter, an author card per commit, "blame before this commit" to walk back through the file's past, and a jump to that commit's diff. It is a panel of its own rather than annotations inside the editor: PPM's extension API exposes no editor, so an extension cannot draw in the gutter. Reachable from the command palette or by right-clicking a file in the graph's commit details.
- **File history** — every commit that touched one file, following it through renames (`--follow`), or the history of just a line range (`-L`). Click a commit for its diff of that file, or blame the file as it stood at that commit.
- **Compare refs** — pick two branches, tags or remotes and see the commits between them beside the files that differ, with ahead/behind counts. Defaults to comparing against the merge base ("since divergence"), which is what a review wants; a direct ref-to-ref diff is one dropdown away.
- **Interactive rebase** — drag commits to reorder them, then reword, edit, squash, fixup or drop, and run it. Reachable from a commit's context menu ("Interactive rebase from here…"). Reword asks for the new message up front, in the panel: git's own `reword` opens an editor mid-rebase and blocks, which the extension API cannot answer, so the message is applied by an `exec git commit --amend` that reads it from the environment — nothing about the message can be re-read as a shell command.
- **Inline blame in the code editor** — the line the cursor is on gets a dimmed "Ada, 3 days ago • fix the parser" after its text, the way GitLens does it. Toggle it from the editor toolbar or with `Alt+B`. The whole file is blamed once and indexed by line rather than re-run per keystroke; because that mapping goes stale the moment you type, the annotation hides itself until the file is saved rather than confidently naming the wrong commit.
- **A GitLens-style hover on the inline blame annotation** — hovering the dimmed "Ada, 3 days ago • fix the parser" opens the whole commit: an initials avatar, both readings of the date ("9 months ago (December 2nd, 2025 4:17 PM)"), the full commit message rather than just its subject, and the diff of *that line* at that commit, coloured. Plus buttons to copy the hash and to open the file's history, its blame or the graph. On a phone, where there is no hover, a tap on the annotation opens the same thing.
  - The line's diff comes from one `git show --unified=0` per commit and line, fetched as the cursor moves rather than when the hover opens, because Monaco reads a hover's content synchronously — fetching lazily would put the answer behind a spinner, which is a mistake this editor has already made once.
  - Monaco ships no `diff` language, so a fenced diff block rendered as plain text: registering one is what makes removals red and additions green.
  - A commit message is not trusted input. Monaco strips `command:` links from untrusted markdown, so a hover needs trust for its own buttons to work — and blanket trust would let anyone who can land a commit put a working button in a hover. The trust is narrowed to this hover's own four commands, and the message is escaped besides.

- **Stage, unstage and discard individual hunks and lines** — the Source Control panel's file rows gain a "Stage lines…" action that opens the file's diff with a checkbox per changed line. The patch is rebuilt server-side with the `@@` counts recomputed and unselected deletions demoted to context, so `git apply` accepts it; untracked files work too, via `git add -N`. If the file changed since the hunks were listed, git rejects the patch instead of staging the wrong lines.
- **Reflog** — everywhere HEAD has been, and the way back from a bad rebase, a mistaken reset or a deleted branch. Filter by action, then create a branch at any entry (the safe recovery, offered first), check it out, or reset to it. `reset --hard` needs the short hash typed to confirm *and* refuses to run at all on a dirty worktree — there is no reflog for uncommitted work.
- **Submodules** — a dropdown in the graph toolbar, shown only when the repository has any, listing each submodule with whether it is checked out, has drifted from the recorded commit, or is conflicted. Update one or all of them, or open one as its own PPM project.
- **Commit search across the whole history** — the graph's find bar previously matched only the rows already loaded, so a match older than the current page simply did not appear. It can now search messages, authors, code changes (`git log -S`) or a file's history in git itself.
- **Author avatars and hover cards in the graph** — initials-based, coloured deterministically from the email. Nothing is sent anywhere; a real avatar service would mean handing every committer's email to a third party.
- **Merge and rebase by dragging a branch badge onto a commit** in the graph, with a confirmation naming exactly what will happen.
- **The commit graph, rebuilt to look like one.** Every commit's node is now its author's avatar ringed in that lane's colour, so a run of commits reads as *who* rather than as a column of identical dots — initials drawn as SVG, never a fetched image, because an avatar service would mean handing every committer's email address to a third party. Branches and tags moved into a **Branch / Tag** column of their own, which is what gives every message the same left edge instead of one that jumps by however long the branch name was. Rows are taller and banded and carry a tick of their lane's colour where the eye starts reading, and the selected row is unmistakable rather than a shade apart from the row above it.
  - On a phone the six columns collapse to one: the graph, the subject, and the author, date and hash on a second line under it, in a 44px row. Six columns of fragments on a 390px screen was not a list of commits — and the alternative already in place, scrolling the whole table sideways, is right for a tablet and wrong for a phone.
  - **A Changes column**, added lines in green and removed in red, the way GitLens shows them. It is a second `git log --shortstat` after the commits have already been drawn: asking the first log for it makes git diff every commit in the window (~100ms for 300 commits here, far more on a large repository) and that wait would land before anything appeared at all. A merge commit has no diffstat, so its cell is empty rather than claiming it changed nothing.
  - **Scroll markers** down the right edge — where the checked-out commit, the selected row and every search match are in the whole loaded history, so a match twenty screens down is visible instead of only reachable. Searching also stopped washing the list yellow: a 15% tint over half the rows on screen buried the thing it was annotating, so a match is now a faint tint plus a bar, and the row you clicked looks selected even when it is also a match.
  - **The commit details panel, rebuilt.** It was a stack of labelled lines under a heading, then the message in a bordered monospace box. A commit message is hard-wrapped by whoever wrote it, so on a wide panel that box filled half the width and left the rest of the row empty. Now it reads the commit twice over: a header bar answering who and how long ago, with the hash and each parent as chips that copy the *whole* hash when clicked (and say that they did) — then, in full, the forty-character hash, every parent, both names with their emails and **both dates with their timezone**. Author date and commit date are always shown separately once they disagree, which is exactly what a rebase or an amend does to them. Every one of those values copies on a click too. A forty-character hash is unreadable as one run of hex, so the eight characters you would actually quote are bright and the remaining thirty-two are dimmed behind them; the dates get a column of their own, so the author's and the committer's line up under each other instead of trailing whatever length the two names happen to be. The subject is set apart from the body, and the body is then read a paragraph at a time: one that was hard-wrapped at somebody's 72 columns is reflowed to the pane in the UI font, while a list, a table, a fence or anything indented keeps every break its author typed and stays in mono. Doing either to the whole message is what fails — verbatim leaves the ragged half-filled column this entry started with, and reflowing everything runs the bullet points together into one line. And on a panel with room, the file list moved into the space beside the message instead of below the fold. Each file shows its name before the directory it sits in, so a narrow column truncates the path and not the name. The two panes carry **a scrollbar each**: a message and a file list are two lists of unrelated length, and scrolling the pair as one meant reaching the twentieth file by pushing the message off the screen. Below the breakpoint they go back to stacking and the panel scrolls as a whole — two scrollers inside one short panel is a trap for a thumb.

### Changed
- **PPM ships its own typefaces: Geist for text, Monaspace for code.** Every stack in the app named fonts and then got none of them. `-apple-system`, `BlinkMacSystemFont` and `Segoe UI` all miss on Linux — the platform PPM is most often self-hosted on — and the generic fallbacks resolve through fontconfig to Liberation Sans, or for a bare `sans-serif` to Liberation *Serif*. So the interface was set in an Arial clone and the editor in whatever `fc-match monospace` happened to answer. `Geist` had been named in the stack since the theme engine landed and was never bundled.
  - **The editor, the diff panes and the conflict resolver are Monaspace Argon at 14px**, with `calt`, `liga` and `ss01`–`ss09` on: the ligatures turn `=>` into an arrow and `!==` into a not-identical sign, and the stylistic sets are where Monaspace's texture healing lives — the part that narrows an `i` beside an `m` so a run like `www.mmm.iii` stops looking like a picket fence.
  - **Inline suggestions are Monaspace Krypton**, a different face at the same metrics. That last part is what makes it safe: Monaco places every character at column times character width, so a ghost-text font with a different advance would slide out of the grid the editor measured with. Monaco has no `inlineSuggest.fontFamily` option, and its own ghost-text rule is loaded *after* the app's stylesheet, so the override has to outweigh it rather than merely match it.
  - **The terminal asks for MesloLGM Nerd Font first** — a shell prompt is full of powerline separators and devicons that only a patched font has. It is deliberately *not* bundled: the patched faces are over a megabyte each and a terminal has to open on a phone too, so it is used where it is installed and Monaspace Argon carries the rest. A terminal that opens during the first paint used to keep whatever fallback was resolved then for the whole session, because xterm bakes the cell size and its glyph atlas from `ctx.font` at `open()`; it now re-measures once the face lands.
  - **First paint costs 37 KB for this**: Geist's Latin and Vietnamese ranges are separate files and only the ones a page actually uses are fetched, the code faces wait until an editor or terminal is on screen, and none of them enter the service worker's precache — which stays at 9 entries. The `woff2` files are not re-compressed, because they already are.
- **The language server is off until you ask for it, and a phone never starts one.** It is a real process on the host — one `typescript-language-server` on one project was **854 MB** resident — so it now waits to be asked instead of starting because a file was opened. Turn it on from the chip in the editor's breadcrumb bar, from Settings, or from the command palette; turn it off again from the panel that chip opens. The setting is per device, which is the point: a desktop switching it on must not start a server for your phone.
  - The browser half is behind a dynamic import, so a session that never turns it on never downloads it either — 17.8 KB of client, providers and conversions (5.3 KB compressed) left the chunk that opening a file pulls in. A single static `import` from the editor would merge it back with nothing about the UI looking different, so a test asserts the boundary rather than a comment asking for it.
  - Monaco's bundled TypeScript service stays unregistered either way. With no server running, a `.ts` file gets word-based suggestions; the alternative was re-registering thirteen providers backed by a 6.8 MB download that only ever sees one file with no `tsconfig.json`.
- **Code wraps by default on a phone.** The wrap toggle lived in a toolbar that is hidden below the `md` breakpoint, so a phone could not reach it and the pref defaulted to off — reading any real file meant scrolling sideways line by line. Wrap is now on by default on a phone-sized screen and has a toggle you can reach: in the editor's mobile toolbar, in the diff viewer's toolbar, in Settings and in the command palette. It is a per-device pref, so turning wrap off on a 27-inch monitor does not turn it off on a 6-inch screen.
- **Inline blame is off on a phone.** The annotation on the cursor's line costs a `git blame` for every file opened and a `git show` for every hover, on the device least able to pay for either. It stays available on a tablet and up.
- **A first load of 1 MB instead of 33, and an editor that works offline.** Four things were each undoing the others:
  - The service worker was precaching **488 files / 33.3 MB** on first visit — every language grammar, every theme, and the 12.7 MB TypeScript worker a previous fix had already made unnecessary to load at all. It now precaches the shell it actually needs to boot: **9 files / 1.08 MB**, with everything else cached as it is used.
  - Nothing was compressed. Every `.js`, `.css`, `.html`, `.json`, `.svg` and source map is now built with brotli and gzip siblings and served with the right `Content-Encoding` and `Vary`: **22.4 MB → 4.33 MB brotli, 5.40 MB gzip (81% smaller)**. Both, not just brotli, because browsers only offer `br` on a secure origin and PPM is routinely reached over plain HTTP on a LAN.
  - Monaco was loaded from the jsdelivr CDN, so the editor did not work offline, did not work on an air-gapped machine, and told a third party which files you open. It is now staged into the bundle (6.65 MB of the 14.97 MB on disk — locales and the unused TypeScript worker are skipped) and served from PPM itself.
  - Measured after: a cold load of a TypeScript file fetches 23 files / 865 KB, with no failed requests and no fallback to running a worker on the main thread.

### Fixed
- **A light theme no longer shows dark extension panels.** A webview is a sandboxed iframe with its own document, so it inherits none of the app's CSS variables and cannot see which theme is on — the only question it could ask was `prefers-color-scheme`, which is the *operating system's* setting. So the git graph, blame, file history, compare and rebase panels all rendered dark inside a light app on any machine whose desktop was dark. PPM now hands each panel the theme it has actually applied, both as a mode and as its own token values, so a panel matches the app rather than the desktop — including the imported VS Code themes and the mobile overrides, because the values are read from the live document rather than mapped a second time.
  - The panels' own palette is still there for the case where nothing is injected, and its dark half moved off near-black onto a charcoal, so the toolbar, the list and the banded rows read as three surfaces instead of one slab. Rows also band harder in dark than in light: the same percentage is not equally visible in the two directions, and a 3.5% lift of near-white over a near-black row is not.
  - A theme change is posted into the panel rather than rewritten into its HTML, because replacing the HTML reloads it — a graph would refetch every commit and lose its scroll position because you switched to light.
- **Commit messages in the graph are no longer rewritten by their own issue links.** The default rule links `#123`, and it was applied *after* the message had been escaped for HTML — so an apostrophe, which escapes to `&#39;`, had its `39` turned into an issue link, and the row rendered a literal `&#39;` with `#39` in link blue. Every message containing an apostrophe was affected, which was most of them. Patterns now match the raw message and escaping happens as the answer is emitted, so an entity can never be formed and then matched; a URL is also claimed before anything inside it can be linked separately and split it in half.
- **Inlay hints were switched on and never appeared.** tsserver returns hints per *kind*, each off unless asked for, so the editor requested them, the server answered "none", and a feature that looked enabled produced nothing — measured as 0 hints across a 2233-line file, now 462. Parameter names only, which is what makes a bare `true` or a positional index readable at a call site; the type hints VS Code also ships off stay off, because they restate what the line already says.
- **The editor was not using a font that exists.** All three Monaco surfaces asked for `Menlo, Monaco, Consolas` — none of which is present on Linux — so they fell through to whatever generic `monospace` resolves to. The terminal already carried a platform-complete stack; all four now share one, so they cannot drift apart again and render in different fonts on the same machine.
- **A hover in a TypeScript file sat on "Loading…" for seconds** after showing the right answer. Monaco's hover widget merges every registered provider and waits for the slowest; PPM had silenced the bundled TypeScript worker's diagnostics but left its other twelve providers registered, and that worker cannot answer anything before fetching 13 MB of TypeScript compiler. So the language server's answer arrived in milliseconds and then waited behind a download. Monaco's TypeScript service is now unregistered outright — which is also what VS Code's renderer does, having no TypeScript worker in it at all. Completions in `.ts` files stop being two merged lists, one of which only ever knew the current file.
- **Git Graph's integration tests no longer depend on your git config** — they spawn git with a replacing environment, which drops `HOME`, so git never read `init.defaultBranch` and created `master` while every assertion named `main`. The test repository now asks for `main` explicitly.
- **Conflict detection worked nowhere** — the git-graph extension detected an in-progress merge, rebase or cherry-pick by spawning `test` and `cat`, but extensions may only spawn git, node, bun, npx and sqlite3, so the call threw. The caller's `catch` then discarded the whole uncommitted-changes payload, so a repository with conflicts showed no staged or unstaged files at all — the one case where the panel mattered most. The markers are now read through the workspace filesystem API.
- **`ppm upgrade` right after a release no longer fails with "No version matching … (but package exists)"** — bun resolved the new version against a cached package manifest that predated it; the upgrade install now bypasses that cache.

## [0.19.4] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Accounts sit side by side again instead of stacked** — the usage panel in chat and both Accounts sub-tabs scroll sideways, so several accounts can be compared without scrolling past the one above, and the fullscreen grid view is back.

## [0.19.3] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **Codex skills show up in the slash picker** — picking one sends it the way codex activates it, so it no longer arrives as plain text that does nothing.
- **Images codex generates appear as pictures in the chat** — with the prompt above them, instead of a file path.

### Changed
- **Settings opens as its own window instead of squeezing into the sidebar** — a category list on the left, the settings themselves on the right, so panes have room to grow. On a phone it opens as a tab you drill into, and the duplicate gear icon in the sidebar rail is gone (there was one in the tab list and one in the footer).
- **Settings categories are grouped** — General and Appearance up top, then AI & Accounts, Integrations and Advanced, instead of one flat list with loose toggles above it.
- **Claude accounts are managed in Settings → Accounts** — adding, removing, enabling, exporting, importing and rotation settings moved out of the popup behind the chat usage chip, which had to fit an account list and four dialogs into a 350px strip. The chip still shows usage and links across. Adding or removing an account now happens in one place rather than two that could disagree.
- **Both account tabs now look the same** — the Codex pane was a different design from the Claude one: raw buttons instead of the shared ones, forms sitting inline down the page instead of dialogs, usage printed as text rather than drawn as bars, and its own colours for the same messages. Switching sub-tabs looked like switching apps. Adding, exporting, importing and rotation are now the same four buttons with the same dialogs on both sides, and both draw accounts as the same card with the same usage bars.
- **Codex sign-ins moved next to the Claude ones** — Settings → Accounts now has a sub-tab per configured provider instead of hiding Codex accounts inside AI Provider’s Codex tab. That tab keeps the provider settings and links across. A provider’s sub-tab only appears once you have configured it.
- **A settings tab can no longer be detached into a second window** — it has a window of its own, so detaching only produced a duplicate with its own remembered position.

### Fixed
- **Codex conversations open with their contents again** — reopening one showed an empty chat while the transcript sat on disk. Existing conversations are relinked on upgrade.
- **Codex usage shows next to Claude's** — quota polling was Claude-only, so the Codex chip stayed blank.
- **The chat toolbar names the Codex account before the first message** — it was blank until a turn started, wherever that account is knowable in advance.
- **Signing in to Codex survives a dropped connection** — the browser could see an error for an account that had in fact been created, and retrying said there was no sign-in to finish.
- **A database connection that fails on a cold network now retries** — connecting over a VPN could fail once and report the database as unreachable.
- **The mobile menu button is now labelled for screen readers** — it was an icon with no accessible name.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **A `▷ Run` button in a `.sql` file now runs one statement, not everything after it** — a comment trailing the semicolon used to leave the statement open, so one Run could fire an `UPDATE` and the rollback written below it in a single go. Semicolons inside strings, comments and `$$` blocks no longer split a statement early either.
- **Editing a cell in a SQL query result saves** — the Save button did nothing and the "pending edits" bar never cleared. Results that can't be traced back to a single table, or tables with no primary key, are now read-only instead of collecting edits that could never be saved.
- **Your custom domain comes back on its own after the machine wakes up** — the connector used to start before Wi-Fi was ready, time out, and fall back to a temporary URL until PPM was restarted, leaving the domain dead. PPM now waits for the network first and retries the domain on its own.
- **`ppm upgrade` right after a release no longer fails with "No version matching … (but package exists)"** — bun resolved the new version against a cached package manifest that predated it; the upgrade install now bypasses that cache.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- **Remote Desktop no longer claims ffmpeg is missing on a Mac that has it** — a PPM started by launchd inherits a bare `PATH` without `/opt/homebrew/bin`; ffmpeg is now also looked for in the usual Homebrew / winget / chocolatey / apt locations, and a "not installed" answer is re-checked instead of being cached until restart, so the checklist really does update once `brew install ffmpeg` finishes.
- **"Session not found" when opening a terminal from outside a project** — the remote-desktop checklist's install button opened a shell with no project; such a terminal now starts in your home directory.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Remote Desktop works on macOS hosts** — the screen is captured with avfoundation and encoded by VideoToolbox, mouse and keyboard are injected through CoreGraphics (no helper binary to install or sign). Typing from a phone's soft keyboard now goes through as text — Android keyboards send no key codes, so until now nothing arrived — and accented or CJK characters land intact on both macOS (CoreGraphics Unicode events) and Windows (`KEYEVENTF_UNICODE`).
- **Remote Desktop can switch between the host's displays** — a dropdown in the window (top-right, next to the stats toggle) and a Monitor button in the mobile toolbar cycle through them; mouse and touch land on the chosen screen even when it sits at negative coordinates. macOS only for now; Windows keeps streaming the whole virtual desktop.
- **Remote Desktop tells you what the host is missing** instead of hiding the entry or showing a black screen: a checklist before connecting covers ffmpeg (one tap types `brew install ffmpeg` / `winget install …` into a PPM terminal) and, on macOS, the Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions (buttons open the right System Settings pane on the host). Missing input permission still lets you watch in view-only mode.

### Fixed
- **A screen-capture ffmpeg no longer outlives its session on macOS** — the process ignores SIGTERM there and would have leaked one per connection.

## [0.18.16] - 2026-09-08

### Changed
- **Remote Desktop is on by default** — the nav entry now shows on any host with ffmpeg, and opening it first shows a warning (whole screen + input, anyone signed in can use it, beta limits) with a "don't show again" option. Set `REMOTE_DESKTOP_ENABLED=0` to remove the feature from a host entirely.

### Fixed
- **A second PPM on the same machine can no longer hijack your domain** — a dev instance under its own `PPM_HOME` derived the same tunnel name, joined the production tunnel, and the hostname then answered from whichever instance Cloudflare picked. Names now include the PPM_HOME, and setup refuses a tunnel another instance is already serving.

## [0.18.15] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- **Remote Desktop (experimental, opt-in)** — stream and control this machine's desktop from any browser or phone: a floating window on desktop, a full-screen view on mobile with touch and trackpad-style mouse modes, pinch-zoom, two-finger scroll, and an on-screen keyboard with function/combo keys. Off by default; turn it on with the `REMOTE_DESKTOP_ENABLED` env var and PPM auth enabled. Still hardening — not for a public tunnel yet.
- **Verified database backups** — hourly `VACUUM INTO` snapshots of the config DB with grandfather-father-son retention, plus `ppm backup` / `ppm restore`.

### Fixed
- **Named tunnel setup is in English** like the rest of the interface — the first-run popup and Tunnel Manager section shipped in Vietnamese by mistake.
- **Nested subagent activity shows on the Agent card** instead of the card freezing on the forking step while a sub-subagent runs.
- **Picture-in-picture keeps a question card's custom input focused**, so you can keep typing an answer after popping the tab out.
- **Tab favicon and title stay scoped to their own window's project** instead of following whichever project was focused last.
- **A disabled account stays disabled** across token refresh, re-add and import; a parked account's token is proven before it re-enters the rotation.

### Changed
- **A clientless AI session holds its subprocess for the real prompt-cache lifetime**, so the next prompt reuses the warm cache instead of paying a cold start.

## [0.18.14] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- **Send a tab straight to picture-in-picture** — right-click a tab (chat, terminal, editor…) and pick "Open in picture-in-picture" for an always-on-top window in one step; closing it puts the tab back in its strip, with no floating window left behind. Chrome/Edge, desktop.

## [0.18.13] - 2026-09-07

### Added
- **Stable public URL on your own domain** — a named tunnel via Cloudflare login pins PPM to `https://<prefix>.<zone>`, no more rotating URL on restart or hibernate; quick tunnel stays the default and the fallback.
- **Quick-tunnel fallback warning** — if a named tunnel fails to start, or its hostname stops resolving, PPM falls back to (or stays on) the quick tunnel and shows why.
- **Temporary link alongside your domain** — the share card can add a throwaway trycloudflare link without touching the permanent one, for sharing once without handing out your hostname.
- **Early notice when the domain stops answering** — a warning appears after about a minute instead of five, and the cloud heartbeat now reports the real state instead of always saying "online".

### Changed
- **Named tunnel setup requires `auth.enabled`** — the popup stays hidden and every mutating tunnel endpoint 403s while PPM auth is off.
- **`~/.cloudflared` is now refused by the file browser API**, the same protection the PPM config directory already had, covering read/copy/move/upload.
- **`ppm stop`/`ppm down` on Windows only kill this PPM's own cloudflared** — the old image-wide `taskkill` also took down every other cloudflared on the machine (another PPM instance, your own tunnels), rotating their URLs.
- **Tunnel and auth secrets are masked wherever config is echoed back** — `ppm config get`, the extension RPC, and `ppm status` never print a raw token, even when an ancestor object (`tunnel`, `auth`) is requested.

### Fixed
- **Share card showed a retired URL** — it kept the first link it ever saw, so it still offered a temporary URL minutes after a permanent one went live; the cloud heartbeat had the same stale value.
- **The offline screen no longer tells you to hunt for a new link** when you arrive through your own domain — that address never changes; it now offers your local-network address instead.
- **Auto-start status works on machines with no service manager** instead of failing outright.
- **File watching on Linux** attaches per-directory handles rather than delegating subtrees, with a larger per-project budget.
- **Notification "Clear all"** now reaches rows that were never created, so unread counts cannot get stuck.
- **Chat toolbar controls stay reachable in a narrow chat pane.**

## [0.18.12] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed
- **npm package no longer includes local investigation scripts** — the 0.18.11 tarball shipped a `.spike/` scratch folder by mistake; it is now excluded.

## [0.18.11] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- **Open any tab in a floating window** — right-click a tab → "Open in window". The tab moves, it does not reload: terminal scrollback, editor undo history and a streaming chat all carry over. Closing the window puts the tab back where it came from; the window is restored on reload. Desktop only.
- **Picture-in-picture for every window** — a titlebar button (Chrome/Edge) sends a floating window — Explorer, System Monitor or a popped-out tab — into an always-on-top window that stays over other apps; menus and dialogs open inside it. Close it or press "Bring back" to return.

### Changed
- **All floating windows share one titlebar** — the macOS/Windows skin chosen for Explorer now applies to every window, so they look alike.

### Fixed
- Chat pickers, the file picker and slash-command list close and navigate correctly when their tab lives in another window.
- Closing a window with a caption button no longer logs an error from the abandoned titlebar drag.

## [0.18.10] - 2026-09-05

### Added
- **End a whole app from System Monitor** — the × on a group row ends the app and all its helper processes in one confirm; groups holding a PPM or system process stay disabled.
- **Resizable process columns** — drag a header's right edge to resize CPU/RAM/Disk/GPU/Net, double-click to reset; widths are remembered per device.

### Changed
- **Trend/Age column removed** from the process table — it starved the process name; uptime now shows in the name tooltip.

### Fixed
- **Aurora Light surfaces are opaque again** — dropdowns, bottom sheets and stacked windows no longer let content bleed through; the pre-theme first paint matches too.

## [0.18.9] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **System Monitor is now a Task Manager for the whole machine** — CPU per core, RAM, disk, network and NVIDIA GPU charts, plus every process grouped by app with live CPU%, RAM, disk I/O and GPU usage; sort by any column, search, filter to PPM's own processes. Opens as a floating window on desktop and a tab on mobile. Works on Windows, where the old monitor showed nothing.
- **End a process from the monitor** — with a confirm dialog and an optional "end child processes" switch. PPM itself, its tunnel and OS-critical processes are refused.

### Fixed
- **Enabling autostart on Windows no longer fails with "Access is denied"** for standard accounts; the logon task is registered from a task definition, and the 72-hour run limit schtasks applied by default is lifted.

## [0.18.8] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- **Images the assistant opens show in the transcript again** — attachments live in the PPM directory, which is shielded to keep the credentials database off the file routes, so every attachment preview, editor open and download answered 403.
- **Seeking an AVI over a tunnel no longer sticks on "Transcoding failed"** — each seek left an ffmpeg job running to the end of the file until the slots ran out.
- **The video player keeps volume, mute and speed across loads**, and rapid seeks no longer stall at 0:00.

## [0.18.7] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- **Uploading into Desktop, Documents or Downloads on a Windows host no longer claims the file already exists** — those folders carry Windows' ReadOnly flag, which the upload path misread as a name collision; Replace then failed on a file that was never there.

## [0.18.6] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **Working teammates show under the conversation** — a bar lists whoever is still running, with the step they are on and how long they have been at it; tap one to open its session. A teammate only produced a card when it was first spawned, so later rounds of work were invisible unless you opened the team panel.

### Fixed
- **Opening a team member works on mobile** — the tap did nothing, because the window it opened is desktop-only; it now opens a full-screen sheet.

## [0.18.5] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **Upload progress panel in the file explorer** — every file shows its own progress, state and error, with Cancel per file and Cancel all; on mobile it lives in a bottom sheet.
- **"Apply to all" on the name-collision prompt** for uploads and copy/move.

### Fixed
- **Uploading several files that already exist no longer hangs at 100%** — concurrent collision prompts overwrote each other, leaving one file waiting forever. Prompts now queue one at a time.
- **Replace during upload moves the old file to the Trash first**, as the prompt promised and as copy/move already did.
- **The Upload… picker reliably delivers the chosen files** on Chromium.

## [0.18.4] - 2026-09-04

### Changed
- **Team members stand out from one-off agents in chat** — a named teammate now leads its card with its handle and gets its own icon, so it is no longer mistaken for a scout that answers once.

## [0.18.3] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **Agent team panel shows who is working and how far along** — each member's live status, current step, model and elapsed time, split into Members and Messages tabs.
- **Click a team member to replay its whole work session** in a floating window.
- **Team conversation now shows both directions** — teammates' replies were only ever recorded in their own session, so the panel used to show tasks going out and nothing coming back.
- **Upload files into the File Explorer** — toolbar button on desktop, mobile picker, and drag files from your OS straight onto a folder.
- **Video player with rotate/flip, playback speed, volume and keyboard shortcuts**; unsupported formats are transcoded on the fly and video seeks properly on slow connections.
- **Open a folder in a dock terminal** from the explorer or the project tree.
- **Send a code block from chat to a terminal, and terminal output back to chat.**

### Fixed
- **Agent teams appear again** — the current AI engine no longer announces team creation the way PPM listened for, so the Team button never showed even with a team running.
- **Team messages are readable** — a task assignment rendered as a wall of raw JSON instead of its subject and description.
- **A backgrounded agent card stays running** until the agent reports back, instead of going idle while it is still working.
- **The session token is now required on every WebSocket connection.**

## [0.18.2] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **Aurora Dark panels are opaque** — dropdowns, bottom sheets and stacked windows no longer show the content behind them through the glass tint.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **"New" tag on the File Explorer button** (desktop rail and mobile drawer) so the 0.18.0 feature is easy to spot.

### Changed
- **New/beta feature tags come from one list** — the "beta" pill on Teams and the new tag share a single registry, so adding or retiring a tag is a one-line change.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- **OS File Explorer window** — a floating, resizable, multi-instance window that browses your whole computer, not just registered projects.
- **Windows / macOS chrome, matching your OS** — Linux gets the macOS look; a Settings override lets you pick either regardless of platform.
- **List, Icons (with thumbnails) and Column (Finder-style) views**, remembered per preference, with keyboard navigation in every view.
- **Sidebar with drives, known folders (Desktop/Documents/Downloads/…) and your OS's pinned folders** (Quick Access, Finder Favorites, GTK/KDE bookmarks), plus PPM's own pins.
- **Double-click opens the right thing** — code/markdown/images/PDF/CSV/video open in PPM's existing tabs; an external `.db`/`.sqlite` file opens in the same table/query viewer projects use.
- **Full OS-style file actions**: Cut/Copy/Paste (including between explorer windows and the project tree), Rename, Move to Trash (with a "Delete permanently" fallback where there's no trash), New file/folder, Copy path, Download, Properties.
- **Drag and drop entries** between explorer windows, onto sidebar places, and onto the project tree — hold Ctrl to copy instead of move.
- **Mobile**: the same explorer opens as a full-screen sheet with long-press actions, multi-select, and a single-column Finder view.
- **Sort by name, size, date or kind** from the toolbar or the right-click menu, in every view.

### Changed
- **Long-press opens context menus after 400 ms** (was 500 ms) everywhere in the app.

## [0.17.57] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **Agent cards keep their tool calls after leaving and reopening a session** — newer AI engines store each agent's activity in a separate transcript file, so reopening showed empty Agent cards and stray agent tool calls in the main chat; the separate transcripts are now merged back into their cards, and an agent event that can't find its card is no longer shown loose.

## [0.17.56] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **A finished chat no longer keeps showing as streaming** — the AI subprocess stays alive between turns, and its stray notifications (skills changing on disk, for one) flipped the session back to "running" with nothing behind them to end it. The tab spinner then ran forever and a page reload did not clear it.
- **The tab spinner clears itself after a dropped connection** — a turn that ended while the app was offline left the indicator on until a full reload. Indicators are now re-checked against the server on every reconnect and project switch.
- **PPM no longer dies when you close the Terminal window you started it from (macOS)** — Terminal.app terminates every process that originated from a window when the window closes, even ones that detached from it, and `ppm start` had been spawning the supervisor directly from your shell. It was meant to hand off to launchd but a status check made that path unreachable, so the "Auto-restart enabled" message was never true. `ppm start` now runs the supervisor under launchd on macOS, which Terminal cannot reach and which restarts it after a crash; the job inherits your shell's `PATH` so chat tools still find `bun`, `node` and Homebrew binaries. If launchd refuses, it says so instead of claiming auto-restart. An instance started by an older version stays terminal-owned until you `ppm stop && ppm start` once.

## [0.17.55] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **A new release can be installed the moment it is announced** — opening the version chip now asks the registry directly instead of reusing an answer up to five minutes old, and a version named in the release notes is enough to offer the update. The panel used to list a new version while refusing to install it.
- **An update found by the background check is no longer withheld** — the two version checks ran on separate clocks and the fresher of the pair could be ignored.

## [0.17.54] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- **Light or dark can be chosen on the login screen** — the saved theme sits behind the password, so a new browser or a fresh share link had no way to reach light mode before signing in.

### Changed
- **A client that has never picked a theme follows the system appearance** — it used to come up dark whatever the OS was set to. An existing choice is untouched.

### Fixed
- **The login screen's dotted backdrop shows up in light mode** — the dots were a hard-coded white, so they disappeared against a pale background.

## [0.17.53] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed
- **Starting the dev server no longer takes over the public URL** — since 0.17.50 the shared link is served by a small forwarder that looks up the running server's port in a file, and `bun dev:server` wrote its own port there, so the public URL quietly served the dev instance instead. Only the server the supervisor started publishes that now, and the supervisor puts it back if anything else overwrites it.
- **A background task finishing no longer ends your turn** — the notification was treated as the turn's result, so the assistant stopped mid-work.

## [0.17.52] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- **Claude Fable 5.1 is selectable** — Anthropic's new flagship model (`claude-fable-5-1`), released 1 September, is now in the model picker, `ppm init` and the proxy test dialog.

## [0.17.51] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **File changes are reported again after a directory is deleted and recreated (Linux)** — switching git branches, or any `rm -rf x && mkdir x`, left everything under that directory silently unwatched until a restart. The runtime cannot revive a watch on such a path, so PPM now falls back to polling just those directories.
- **The resource panel and tunnel list no longer come back empty on slim Linux images** — both read the process table through `ps`, which minimal containers do not ship, and treated the missing command as "no processes". They read the kernel directly now.

## [0.17.50] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **The public share URL survives an upgrade** — it rotated whenever a leftover background process from a chat kept the old server port open, because the tunnel is tied to one port and had to be recreated when the server moved. A small forwarder now owns the public port and passes traffic to the server wherever it lands, so upgrades, restarts and crashed servers no longer change the link you shared. A dead `cloudflared`, a reboot or resuming from sleep still can.
- **The port stops creeping upward** — each time this happened the server took the next port (3212 → 3213 → 3214) and never went back. It no longer needs a fixed port at all.

## [0.17.49] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **Subagent tool activity no longer spills into the main chat** — since the SDK upgrade a background agent keeps running after the turn ends, and its tool calls rendered as loose top-level entries; they now stay nested under the Agent card, both live and after reload.

## [0.17.48] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **AgentKit skills work again** — `/ak:debug` and the rest stopped resolving after Claude Code changed how it names a plugin's skills, and every one of them was listed twice in the picker. PPM now uses the name the runtime actually registers (`ak-engineer:ak-debug`) and converts the old one for you, so what you already type keeps working.

### Added
- **A message sent from another device now appears** — with the same chat open on a phone and a laptop, a turn started on one showed only the reply on the other.

## [0.17.47] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- **A chat no longer dies for good on an image the API will not accept** — the bundled Claude Code SDK was 105 releases behind, and on that build a single oversized image in the history failed every later message, plain text ones included. Updating it clears the whole class of failure.
- **A chat that still hits a refused image now repairs itself** — the offending image is dropped from the history and the message retried, instead of repeating "Invalid request sent to the API" with no way out from inside PPM.
- **The update button appears as soon as you open the app** — the check only replayed what the background service last recorded, and that lands five minutes after startup, so a window opened before then offered no update while the release notes beside it already listed the newer version.

### Changed
- **Image cleanup now works on the chats that need it** — the session debug panel refused any history over 64MB, which was exactly the ones worth cleaning. It streams the file instead, and counts images you attached separately from ones a tool read, since only the first have no copy elsewhere.

## [0.17.46] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- **Continuing a long chat no longer costs several times more than it should** — a chat's whole history is re-sent to Claude on every message, and that is only cheap while it still matches a cached copy, which is held per account and expires after five minutes. Refreshing a tab, switching apps on a phone or letting a laptop sleep ended the chat's process, and the next message went to whichever account came next in the rotation — paying full price for the entire history again. A chat now stays on one account and keeps its process across a reconnect.
- **A chat no longer hops between accounts when they are all near their 5-hour limit** — it used to swap accounts on every message in exactly the situation where swapping costs the most, since each swap re-sends the history uncached. It now stays put unless another account genuinely has room.
- **A chat no longer stays stuck on an account whose weekly limit is spent** — the check only looked at the 5-hour window, so an account with nothing left for the week kept serving as soon as that window reset.
- **The chat header shows the account serving *this* chat** — with two chats open on two accounts it named whichever one ran most recently, so at least one of them was wrong.
- **Usage for a newly added account appears right away** — it used to stay blank until the next scheduled refresh.

### Added
- **A chat now tells you when a message cost more than it had to** — a note under the reply explains how much of the history was re-sent uncached, roughly how many times more that made the message cost, and what restarted the chat.
- **Per-message token and cache history** — the session debug panel (bug icon) lists recent messages with how much of the history came from cache, what it cost and which account served it, so an expensive chat can be compared against its own cheaper messages.

### Changed
- **An idle chat releases its process once its cached history expires** — timed from its last message rather than from when the tab closed, so a process is never held alive protecting a cache that has already lapsed.
- **At most five idle chats keep a process warm** — beyond that the longest-idle one is released first, which bounds memory when chats are left open across several devices.
- **The account is no longer repeated under every reply** — it appears once in the header, for the chat it belongs to.

## [0.17.45] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- **Updating no longer leaves a second copy of PPM running** — each update started a replacement that the system service manager could not see, so it started one of its own as well. The abandoned copy kept its server, its chat agents and its own public tunnel alive, and the copies piled up with every release until the machine ran out of memory. Updates now hand back to the service manager, so exactly one copy survives.
- **Chat agents are shut down with the server that owns them** — on macOS and Linux they were only reachable through a shortcut that never actually applied, so they outlived their server by days, holding memory and keeping its port occupied. They are now found and stopped properly.
- **A port that is already taken is reported instead of quietly worked around** — PPM used to slide onto the next free port and keep running there as an extra instance. It now clears out its own leftovers and otherwise says what is holding the port.

## [0.17.44] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- **Background command logs open again on macOS** — the output panel showed "Access denied" because newer SDK builds write logs to `/tmp/claude-<uid>/…` and the server only allowed the old folder name.

## [0.17.43] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **Reloading on mobile no longer re-downloads the whole app** — app files are cached by the browser (~7MB → ~0 per reload) and API responses are gzip-compressed (~5-8× smaller), cutting a reload on 4G from ~9.5MB to ~130KB.
- **Opening a chat no longer downloads its transcript twice** — the redundant refresh right after connecting is skipped when nothing changed, which also stops transcript images re-downloading.

## [0.17.42] - 2026-08-31

### Changed
- **The file explorer no longer freezes on huge folders** — opening a 700-entry folder like `node_modules` used to lock the page for half a second; only the rows on screen are drawn now, so it opens in a blink at any size.
- **Folders open instantly when browsing remotely** — the explorer loads one level ahead of your clicks in the background, and a 4-level dive over a tunnel dropped from ~1.2s to ~0.2s by fetching the levels in one request.
- **The explorer remembers which folders you had open** — reopening a project restores them in a single request instead of starting collapsed.

## [0.17.41] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **Upgrading no longer changes the public tunnel URL when a leftover dev server is holding the port** — processes started from chat (like `bun run dev:web`) could keep the dead server's port reserved, forcing the new server onto another port and rotating the tunnel address. They are now cleaned up during startup.

## [0.17.40] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed
- **A stalled connection could leave the usage readout and the chat transcript loading forever** — both waited on a request with no time limit, so on a connection that never answered they stayed stuck until a reload, the same way the message box did in 0.17.37. Requests that share an answer between components now stop sharing one that has gone quiet, so a single stalled connection can no longer hold back everything asking for the same thing.

## [0.17.39] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- **A login started in the terminal can be finished from your phone** — `aws sso login` and friends listen on a port of the machine, so signing in on another device leaves them waiting forever. The link list now says which port a login returns to, and takes the address the sign-in landed on so the machine can deliver it.

### Fixed
- **The terminal lurched every time the mobile keyboard opened** — the dock measured itself against a viewport that ignores the keyboard, then jumped and left the terminal a few rows tall. It now takes the whole visible area while you type, keeps the toolbar directly above the keyboard, and tells the shell about the new size once instead of on every frame of the animation.
- **A see-through band sat under the mobile terminal toolbar** — the sheet was being lifted off the bottom of the screen, and its background went with it. The sheet stays put now and only its contents move.
- **Dropped the stray divider between the dock's drag handle and its tab bar.**

## [0.17.38] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- **The terminal can be selected and copied on a phone** — a Select button turns a one-finger drag into a real selection. Copy falls back to the last command's output when nothing is selected, and now says what it copied.
- **Links printed by the terminal are tappable** — a Links button lists the URLs in the scrollback to open or copy, so an `aws sso login` code no longer has to be read off a screenshot.

### Fixed
- **Every button in a mobile dock tab did nothing** — the terminal toolbar, its keys and its clipboard actions were all inert because the tab's DOM sat outside the container React delivers events to. Typing still worked, which made it look like only the buttons were broken.
- **The mobile terminal toolbar was cut off by the browser chrome** — the dock sheet handed its content the full sheet height while the drag handle sat above it, pushing the bottom row into the home-indicator band. The last two keys were also stranded off-screen with no hint the row scrolled.
- **A toast covered the toolbar that raised it** — toasts sat bottom-left, over the mobile dock's key row, and ate the next tap. They now appear at the top on phones.

## [0.17.37] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- **A new chat tab could open with no message box until you reloaded** — the input waited on the draft request, which on a stalled connection never answered and never failed. That one stalled request also held back every chat tab opened after it. Requests now give up after 30 seconds without a reply, and the input appears within 3 seconds either way.

## [0.17.36] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- **The whole app went blank at a plain address whenever the Teams tab was the open one** — the group dialog asked for a random id that browsers only hand out over `https://` or `localhost`, and it asked on every render rather than when the dialog opened, so the failure took the entire page down instead of just the dialog.
- **A split panel could be left blank with no way to close it** — a panel holding only a tab belonging to a project that no longer exists showed no tabs, no empty state and no close button. Affected layouts are now repaired on load, and an empty panel can be closed from a button or a middle-click.

## [0.17.35] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **The image viewer zooms, pans, rotates and flips** — pinch on a trackpad or touch screen, wheel or drag with a mouse, plus fit, actual size, a zoom readout, download, copy, and arrows to walk the other images in the same conversation.
- **Session debug can clear the images out of a transcript** — a conversation re-sends every image it holds each time it resumes. The dialog now counts them and removes either the oversized ones or all of them, warning when an image is past the 2000-pixel limit the API rejects anyway.

## [0.17.34] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Images the assistant reads now appear in the chat** — a `Read` on an image file shows the picture beside its dimensions, size and path, with actions to open it in the editor, copy the path, or view it full size. The card used to print the image's raw base64 instead, sending roughly 1.4MB of text per megabyte of image to the browser with nothing truncating it.

## [0.17.33] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **Claude's own slash commands now show in the picker** — `/context`, `/init`, `/usage`, `/goal`, `/review` and the rest live inside the Claude CLI with no file on disk, so the picker never found them. They are now fetched from the SDK once per project.
- **`/clear` opens a new chat tab** — the SDK treats it as a no-op because session lifecycle belongs to the app. Any text after it becomes the tab title, and the chat it was cleared from is recorded.

### Fixed
- **Searching the slash picker ignored what you use most** — the unfiltered list was ordered by recent use, but typing reordered it alphabetically. Recent commands now stay on top, promoted just enough to beat an equally relevant match.
- **A terminal tab could not be closed from the editor grid** — closing it moved the terminal into the dock and pulled the dock open. Parking a live session is now only the explicit "Move to Dock" action.
- **The dock covered the whole screen on mobile after a reload** — a dock left open on desktop synced across and reopened as a full-height sheet. Restored dock state now starts collapsed on mobile.

## [0.17.32] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed
- **A forked chat and the chat it was forked from could not both appear in the history list** — the list showed one of the two and hid the other, and which one it hid kept changing: refresh after working in the fork and the original was gone, refresh after working in the original and the fork was gone. Pinning one of them brought both back, which was the only reliable way to reach either. Forking a chat and editing one of your earlier messages both create a new chat behind the scenes, and the history list deliberately folds the versions of an edited message into a single row, so that revising one message five times does not leave five near-identical rows behind. The two kinds were not being told apart, so a fork — a separate conversation you opened in its own tab on purpose — was folded in as though it were just another version of an edited message, and only whichever of the pair had been written to most recently survived the fold. A fork is now recorded as a conversation in its own right and always keeps its own row, whichever side you last used. Edited messages still collapse into one row, with the other versions reachable from the arrows on the message itself. Forks and edits made before this release can no longer be told apart, so all of them are now treated as forks and will each keep a row — a message you had revised several times may therefore show more rows in the list than it used to.

## [0.17.31] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- **A finished reply now tells you which of your files it changed** — at the end of every reply that touched a file, the row of buttons underneath it gains a small summary reading something like "4 files +312 −41". Opening it lists the files that reply changed: what happened to each one — created, overwritten, edited — how many times it was touched, and how many lines went in and out. Opening one of those files lists that file's individual edits with their diffs. Every row is also a jump: clicking one scrolls the conversation back to the exact tool card that made that change and flashes it, so the summary acts as an index into a long reply rather than as a second copy of it. On a phone it opens as a sheet from the bottom of the screen; on a desktop it opens beside the reply as a two-pane panel you can move through with `j` and `k` and jump from with `enter`. It appears only on replies that actually changed a file. Two things worth knowing: the separate edits to one file are shown one by one rather than merged into a single before-and-after, because each edit describes only its own fragment of the file and those fragments cannot be stitched back together; and edits made by a sub-agent appear while the reply is still running but are gone from the summary after a reload, because a sub-agent's steps are never written to disk, so after the fact there is nothing left to list.
- **A share link that survives a restart** — the share link PPM hands out changes every time it restarts, so a link you sent to your phone has usually stopped working by the next day. A permanent address that always points at your machine was already available, but nothing in the interface said so: the only way in was an unlabelled icon in the side rail. The share popover now explains the rotation while you are signed out, offers to set a permanent address up, and shows that address once it is linked; if it cannot read your current one it now says so rather than looking as though you have none, which previously risked quietly replacing a link already in use. It is reachable from the command palette on both desktop and phone, and the startup banner mentions it when you are sharing without one. Claiming an address no longer requires the command line.

### Fixed
- **Notebook edits showed a blank file path** — the card for an edit to a notebook displayed no path at all, because it looked for the field the other file tools use rather than the one notebooks are passed under.

### Changed
- Two claims that were not true have been dropped from the documentation: browser notifications do not currently arrive at all — only Telegram does — and the cloud stores an account email alongside machine names and share addresses.

## [0.17.30] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **Every copy button did nothing when PPM was opened at a plain address** — reaching PPM over `http://` rather than `https://`, which is what happens with a Tailscale machine name or a bare LAN address, left every Copy in the interface inert: copying a chat message, a code block, a file path, a project path, a share link, a proxy setting, a set of database rows. Worse, most of them still reported success — the button flipped to a tick, the toast said "URL copied" — while nothing had reached the clipboard. Browsers only hand out the clipboard interface to pages served over a secure connection, of which `localhost` counts as one and a plain address does not, so on those addresses the interface was simply absent; PPM asked for it anyway and quietly discarded the resulting error. Copies now go through one shared routine that falls back to the older selection-based method, which browsers still allow on plain addresses, so the same buttons work at whatever address you happen to be using. The ones that report an outcome now report the real one, and the two account-backup buttons still fall back to downloading a file. Pasting *from* the clipboard is a separate permission that plain addresses genuinely cannot be granted, so terminal paste and importing database connections from the clipboard still need a secure address; the mobile editor's paste button already offers a long-press box for that case.

## [0.17.29] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- **PPM said it had started but nothing answered** — `ppm start` printed the local address and a share link, yet neither localhost nor the link ever responded, and the status file kept insisting everything was running while every process it referred to was already dead. Two things went wrong in sequence, both on Windows. First, before starting the server, PPM briefly listens on the port itself to make sure it is free; starting the share tunnel at the same moment made Windows hand the tunnel a copy of that short-lived listening socket — a copy the tunnel never closes — so the port stayed occupied and the real server could never take it, timing out after ten seconds on every attempt. Second, the supervisor then went looking for whichever process was hogging the port so it could clear it out, and the answer came back as the supervisor itself — which it dutifully killed, taking the server, the tunnel and its own status reporting down with it. That is why the status file still said "running": nothing was left alive to correct it. The port check and the starting of child processes now take turns instead of overlapping, so the socket can no longer leak into a child; and if the port ever does show up as held by the supervisor itself, it restarts the tunnel — the only thing that can actually be holding the leaked copy — rather than killing itself.
- **PPM's reserved memory could grow without limit on Windows** — the supervisor takes a periodic inventory of the helper processes the server has started, so that after a crash it knows exactly what to clean up. Each inventory launches a PowerShell and builds a list of every process on the machine, which is fine on its own — but on a busy machine one inventory could still be running when the next fired, and every simultaneous run permanently reserved a chunk of memory that was never returned to the system. Left long enough this ratcheted up to an observed 19GB of reserved memory against 1GB actually in use. Inventories now run one at a time — a tick that finds the previous one still running simply skips its turn — and a PowerShell that gets stuck is cut off after twenty seconds instead of lingering forever.

## [0.17.28] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- **Press the up arrow to bring back what you typed before** — the composer now keeps the messages you sent in this chat, the way a terminal keeps your command history. From an empty composer the up arrow steps back through them one at a time and the down arrow comes forward again; start typing and whatever you recalled turns back into an ordinary draft. Anything the composer added on the way out is stripped back off, so you get what you actually typed, and if the message was addressed to a particular agent that comes back as a chip rather than as text you have to delete by hand. The arrows only do this while the composer is empty, so they still move the cursor around inside a draft you are in the middle of writing.

### Fixed
- **PPM was quietly using up the machine's file-watching capacity** — watching a single project could consume hundreds of thousands of the system's file-watch slots, and on Linux those slots are shared with everything else running, so editors, language servers and dev servers could start missing file changes or fail to watch anything at all. On one machine PPM alone held 359,058 of the 524,288 available, with the system at 91.6% overall. Asking to watch a folder and everything beneath it looks like one request, but the operating system charges for it one folder at a time, and PPM was asking for the entire project — dependency folders included — then discarding the notifications it did not want after having paid for them. In this repository that meant 18,731 folders watched in order to usefully follow about 200. PPM now decides what to watch before asking instead of filtering afterwards, leaving dependency, build and cache folders out from the start, which brings the same repository down to 198. There are also limits per project and across all of them so no single project can run away with the machine's capacity, and a folder that cannot be watched is now reported rather than silently going quiet over that part of the project. Separately, a project that never stopped changing — a build running, a large branch switch — could stop reporting changes to the editor and file tree entirely, because every new change pushed the notification further out; they now go out on a steady beat.

## [0.17.27] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **The message navigation no longer sits on top of the conversation** — the two round arrows anchored to the bottom-right corner of a chat floated above the transcript rather than beside it, so on longer messages they covered the last line or two of your own text and clipped the right edge of whatever tool result happened to be underneath them. They are replaced by a single dim dot about a third of the size, which stays out of the way until you click it. It then opens into the same up and down arrows, a counter showing which of your messages you are currently level with, and a new button that jumps straight to the end of the conversation; it folds back into the dot a few seconds after you stop using it. Two shortcuts were added for the same jumps — Alt with the up or down arrow — and they keep working while you are typing in the message box, since that is where the cursor sits for most of a conversation. Both appear under Settings as "Previous Chat Message" and "Next Chat Message" and can be changed there.

### Fixed
- **Dictation started in every open chat at once** — with more than one chat open, the voice input shortcut switched the microphone on in all of them instead of the one you were working in, so turning it back off meant pressing the shortcut once per chat. Chats stay loaded in the background once opened, so that switching between them is instant, and the shortcut was reaching every one of them equally. It now applies only to the chat you are actually in, whether it comes from the keyboard or from the command palette.

## [0.17.26] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **PPM could go silently dead right after an upgrade** — once the upgrade finished, neither the local address nor the share link answered any more; the page simply spun forever instead of failing. `ppm status` insisted everything was running, and `ppm restart` changed nothing, so the only way back was `ppm stop --kill` followed by `ppm start`. Before starting the server, PPM checks that the port is free by briefly listening on it itself. That check is a real listening socket, so the browser tabs, extensions and chat windows all reconnecting after the upgrade could connect to it — and a socket with a connection open never finishes closing, so the check never returned an answer and the server was never started at all. Everything around it stayed healthy, which is why nothing reported a problem: the supervisor was alive, the share tunnel was alive, and the port was open and accepting connections — just never replying. The check now refuses connections and gives up after two seconds, and three further gaps that let this go unnoticed are closed: the health check now starts a server that was never started rather than only watching one that already exists, `ppm restart` now starts a server when there is none to restart, and `ppm status` now asks the server itself instead of trusting its own notes.
- **Upgrading dropped the share link and started over** — every upgrade was supposed to hand the running tunnel to the new version so the public address stays the same, and it did, but on macOS the replacement was killed a second later and a cold one started in its place, with a new address. The upgrade works by starting the new version and stepping aside, and macOS was treating the replacement as part of the outgoing version and shutting it down along with it. The replacement now runs in its own right, so the handover survives.

## [0.17.25] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **The database sidebar forgot which connections and tables you had opened** — expanding a connection and a few of its tables lasted only until the page was reloaded, and even switching to another sidebar panel and back was enough to collapse the whole tree, leaving you to click your way down to the same table again and again. The open state was held only in the browser's memory for as long as that panel stayed on screen, and nothing ever wrote it down. It is now kept alongside your other interface preferences, which live on the PPM server rather than in the browser alone, so it also survives opening PPM at a different address or from another device. Restoring the tree fetches what it needs again: the table list for each connection that was open, and the columns of each table that was expanded. Connections you delete are removed from the record, so it cannot fill up with entries for things that no longer exist.

## [0.17.24] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **Accounts kept expiring and had to be signed in again** — an account could stop working overnight and show as expired, with no way back other than signing in again. PPM is meant to renew each account an hour before its access runs out, but an internal check disagreed with that: it refused any renewal while more than a minute of access remained, so the early renewal never actually happened and accounts were only ever renewed *after* they had already stopped working. That left a window of a few minutes in which PPM had to reach Anthropic successfully. Access runs out eight hours after the previous renewal, so that window drifts and regularly lands in the middle of the night — precisely when the machine is likely to be asleep or the network briefly unavailable. Anthropic's permission to renew lapses shortly after access itself does, so a single missed window lost the account permanently. Renewal now begins a full hour early as intended, which gives around twelve attempts before anything is at risk, and a renewal that fails because of a network error or a temporary server error is retried immediately instead of waiting for the next attempt. A renewal rejected outright is still reported rather than retried.
- **Sharing produced a link that answered every request with "not found"** — if you also use cloudflared yourself, turning on sharing gave a link that connected but served nothing, and PPM would discard it and generate a replacement over and over without ever settling. cloudflared automatically reads its own configuration file at `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`, including for the temporary tunnels PPM creates. Anyone running their own named tunnel has routing rules in that file, and those rules were being applied to PPM's tunnel too — among them the customary catch-all that answers everything with "not found" before the request can reach PPM. PPM now points cloudflared at its own empty configuration file, so your setup no longer leaks into it. Cleaning up leftover tunnel processes was also looking for the old command line and quietly missing them, which could leave orphaned tunnels running; it now matches them correctly.

## [0.17.23] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed
- **Skills installed as Claude Code plugins never showed up** — PPM looked for skills, commands and agents only in `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.claude/commands` and `~/.claude/agents`. Anything delivered as a Claude Code plugin lives elsewhere, under `~/.claude/plugins`, so none of it was listed: typing `/` showed a menu with the plugin's skills missing entirely. This stayed hidden while most toolkits wrote their files straight into `~/.claude`, but one that ships as a plugin would leave the menu nearly empty. PPM now reads the plugin install registry and picks up the skills, commands and agents each installed plugin provides. Plugins you have turned off in your Claude Code settings are left out; a plugin your settings never mention still shows, since being installed is what decides that it exists. Skills you wrote yourself in `~/.claude/skills` continue to take precedence over a plugin's skill of the same name.

## [0.17.22] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Deleting or editing a row failed silently** — removing a row that other rows referenced appeared to do nothing at all: no error, no message, the row simply stayed. The request was being rejected by the database and the reason travelled all the way back to the browser, but no part of the viewer ever displayed it. Failures from deleting, bulk-deleting, editing a cell and inserting a row now surface as a message showing what the database actually said, such as a foreign key violation or a connection being in read-only mode.
- **SQLite ignored foreign keys, so the viewer could orphan rows** — SQLite only enforces foreign keys when each connection asks it to, and PPM never did. A delete that other tools correctly refuse would go through here, quietly leaving behind rows pointing at something that no longer existed. Foreign keys are now enforced on every SQLite connection PPM opens. Existing data is untouched — only new writes are checked — but a delete that was silently accepted before will now be refused with a clear reason. Scripts that relied on the old behaviour can opt out per script with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;`.

### Added
- **Query audit log** — every statement you run is now recorded: what was run, when, against which connection, how long it took, how many rows it touched, and a sample of the result (first and last few rows). This covers SQL you type in the editor, edits made through the data grid, column filters, and the `ppm db` command line. Failed and refused attempts are recorded too, so a rejected write leaves a trace instead of disappearing. The log lives in its own file, separate from your settings and chat history, and is never allowed to interfere with a query — if recording fails, the query still runs and PPM tells you the log is broken rather than staying quiet about it.
- **Audit log limits under Settings → Query Audit Log** — the log is pruned automatically by age and by size, whichever comes first, defaulting to 30 days or 500 MB. Both are adjustable, the current size and entry count are shown, and the whole log can be cleared in one action.

## [0.17.21] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **Slow first load when many chat tabs are open** — reloading the page took tens of seconds to show the chat you were looking at, on both desktop and mobile. Every tab saved in the workspace was being loaded at once, not just the visible one, so a workspace with 18 chat tabs fired **515 requests and 36.7 MB** on a single reload and the tab you actually wanted queued behind tabs you could not see. Tabs now load when you first open them and stay loaded afterwards, so switching back to a tab you have already visited is still instant. Measured on that same workspace: no failed requests (was 169), and the slowest request dropped from 16.3s to 0.55s.
- **Version info was requested once per chat message** — every message in a conversation made its own request to check whether it had edited versions, and 96% of those came back as errors (169 requests, 165 errors, on one reload). The `‹ 1/9 ›` version switcher now receives everything it needs together with the message history, in a single request.
- **Chat images were re-downloaded every time a tab opened** — uploaded images had no caching headers, so a single 1.4 MB screenshot was fetched again on every mount: 2.8 MB of a 3.1 MB tab-open. Uploads are now cached permanently by the browser (they are write-once), so an image downloads once and never again.
- **Opening a chat tab fired several duplicate requests** — different parts of the UI asked for the same project data at the same moment (the model list was requested four times, the session list four times). Requests that are already in flight are now shared, so each is made once. This shares only in-flight requests, so nothing is ever served stale.
- **Skill suggestions were slow the first time you typed `/` in a new tab** — the command list (23 KB, identical for every tab) was re-fetched on each tab open, and the suggestion popup stays hidden until it arrives. It is now fetched once per project.
- **Chat images could disappear from old conversations** — uploads were written to the operating system's temporary folder, which the OS is free to clear on cleanup or reboot, breaking images in past chats. They now live under `~/.ppm/uploads`; images already uploaded to the old location still load.
- **Development journals were being published to npm** — an ignore rule targeted `docs/journal/` but the folder is `docs/journals/`, so 17 internal notes shipped in the package.

### Added
- **Recently used chat tabs are warmed in the background on desktop** — once the page settles, up to three recently used chat tabs load quietly so switching to them feels instant. They load one at a time and stop for anything you click, and this is skipped entirely on mobile so it never spends cellular data on tabs you may not open.

### Internal
- File watching and app-wide events (editor live-reload, file-tree refresh, cross-device unread sync) moved onto a dedicated `/ws/global` connection. They previously rode on the chat WebSocket, which only existed while a chat tab happened to be mounted — with tabs now loading lazily, that would have silently disabled them.

## [0.17.20] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **Table header smearing after a sort** — sorting a table left the column headers looking doubled and blurry, as if the grid were lagging. The grid draws its header on a canvas but was filling it with a see-through surface colour, so each repaint painted the new header on top of the old one instead of replacing it. Surface colours are now resolved against the page background before they reach the grid — this affects the Aurora themes, where the panel colour is translucent.
- **Columns resizing themselves on every sort or page change** — column widths were estimated from whichever rows happened to be loaded, so changing sort or turning the page reshuffled the whole layout. Widths are now measured once per table and stay put; resizing a column by hand still overrides them, and opening a different table re-measures.

## [0.17.19] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- **Thinking blocks missing from chat** — reasoning stopped appearing in the transcript because the CLI now streams thinking frames with an empty body (token estimates only), leaving nothing to render. PPM now asks for summarized reasoning so the content comes through again. Thinking is also carried through the SDK's own config instead of the deprecated token budget, and a session's thinking state keeps its three values (inherit / on / off) — previously a session that had never opted out was reported as "off" and saved back as an explicit disable.
- **Database preview panel showing stale data** — opening the JSON/cell viewer on a record and then reloading the table left the panel displaying the record's old value. The viewer now reads from the current rows, so a reload refreshes it in place; it tracks the record by primary key, so reloads that reorder rows still follow the same row, and closes itself if that row is gone.

## [0.17.18] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- **Cloud & Share unreachable on mobile** — the button to sign in to PPM Cloud, link the device, and start sharing lived only in the desktop sidebar rail, which is hidden on phones — so there was no way to link a device from mobile. A **Cloud & Share** entry now sits in the mobile drawer footer (next to Report Bug) and opens the same panel as a bottom sheet.

## [0.17.17] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- **Teams group chat, reimagined as a real conversation (beta)** — the Teams group chat now behaves like a natural group chat instead of a task swarm. You message the group and the right agents reply on their own (no more waiting for @mentions), continuing the thread with whoever you were just talking to. A lightweight router picks 1–N responders based on the recent conversation, runs independent replies in parallel, and lets the leader wrap up with a summary after delegating; the group can also stay quiet when there's nothing to add. Each of your messages always gets at least one reply. Agents now **remember the conversation** across messages (their sessions are kept alive), and teammates see each other's **full replies**, not clipped snippets.
- **Member management for a group** — add, edit (name / persona / model), remove members, and reassign the leader after a group is created.
- **Per-team reply cap** — set how many AI turns a single message can trigger (1–50), configurable per group.
- **Beta badge on the Teams tab** — the Teams entry now shows a small "beta" marker in both the desktop rail and the mobile drawer.
- **Rich transcript viewer** — "view full transcript" now renders like the live chat (assistant text, collapsible thinking, tool calls with inputs/outputs, and the session's input config) instead of raw JSONL, and works on a member's live (unarchived) session. The entry point is a subtle top-right icon (hover on desktop, long-press menu on mobile).

### Fixed
- **Group chat reliability** — your first message on a brand-new group now shows immediately (no tab reopen), messages no longer go missing across consecutive replies, a member's per-message model is respected (was always using the provider default), timestamps render correctly, and group turns no longer request the 1M-context beta that some subscriptions reject.
- **Mobile group chat** — the members panel opens as a dismissable bottom sheet (tap backdrop / swipe down) instead of an overlay you couldn't close.
- **In-app self-upgrade** — a server restart mid-upgrade is no longer surfaced as an error (e.g. a transient 502 through a tunnel); the app waits for the new version and reloads automatically.

## [0.17.16] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Unified model + thinking picker on the chat input** — the model chip is now a single picker that also sets the reasoning **effort** (Low / Medium / High / Extra / Max) and toggles **Thinking** on/off, both per session and remembered across turns (and restored on reconnect). New models **Claude Opus 5** and **Claude Sonnet 5** are selectable. The popup is two columns — models on the left, effort + thinking on the right — and becomes a bottom sheet on mobile. Effort/thinking still fall back to the global AI Settings when a session hasn't overridden them.

### Fixed
- **Attachment-only chat messages now render** — user messages containing only attachments (no text) were previously blank; they now display, and links inside messages are clickable.
- **Disabled or rotated OAuth tokens stay usable** — accounts whose OAuth token had been disabled or rotated were dropped, forcing avoidable re-authentication; they are now kept alive.

## [0.17.15] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- **Windows upgrade broken by illegal filename in the npm package** — upgrading on Windows failed with `error: ENOENT extracting tarball` because a stray absolute host path (`C:/Users/.../AppData/Local/Temp/ppmbuild/index.js`) had leaked into the published package. A drive-letter colon is an illegal Windows filename, so extraction aborted before any file was written, silently blocking the in-app upgrade (Linux/macOS were unaffected — a colon is a legal filename there). The stray path is removed and `.npmignore` now excludes `Users/`, `AppData/`, and `ppmbuild/` so build-tool path leaks can't reach the tarball again. Windows installs on 0.17.13–0.17.14 can upgrade to this version normally.

## [0.17.14] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- **Mobile tab switcher "Recent" order** — with multiple split panels, the mobile tab-switcher's "Recent" sort concatenated each panel's history, so the tab you were actually on could sit below older tabs from an earlier panel. It now ranks by a true global most-recently-active order across all panels (and persists across reload): the current tab is always on top, and selecting a tab moves it to the top.

## [0.17.13] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Teams group chat (beta)** — a new "Teams" sidebar section lets you assemble a group of AI agents (a leader plus members, each with its own persona and model) and hand them a task. They split the work, discuss in a shared channel using @mentions, and converge to a final answer — rendered as a live team chat: each speaker has their own color across avatar, name, left accent bar, and highlighted @mentions; the message you send shows as "You"; the leader's closing message is boxed as the final. Includes a member roster with live typing/status, per-message summaries you can expand to the full archived transcript, and Stop/Resume (Resume re-spawns fresh agent sessions and continues from the durable message history). Marked **beta**.
- **Customizable sidebar tabs** — sidebar/drawer tab order is now user-arranged via drag-and-drop and syncs across devices (desktop rail: mouse drag; mobile drawer: long-press drag). One shared order drives both platforms.
- **Mobile drawer tab overflow** — the mobile bottom tab bar now uses fixed-width slots with a responsive visible count and a "More" sheet for the rest, so it never overflows regardless of how many tabs (built-in + Jira + extensions) exist. Selecting an overflow tab surfaces it in the last slot without shifting the row.
- **Extension views on mobile** — extension-contributed sidebar views now appear in the mobile drawer (previously desktop-only).

## [0.17.12] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- **AI chat works on binary installs** — chat failed on GitHub-release binaries with "Native CLI binary for … not found". The Claude Agent SDK looks for its own bundled CLI (not a system `claude`), which a compiled binary doesn't carry. PPM now resolves a CLI: an explicit `PPM_CLAUDE_CLI` override, then a system `claude` (PATH or common install locations), then a version-matched `claude` now bundled in each release archive. Source (bun/npm) installs are unaffected.

## [0.17.11] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Binary installs can start again** — `ppm start` from a GitHub-release binary exited immediately with `error: unknown command '__supervise__'`. The compiled binary re-invokes itself to launch its supervisor and server daemons, but the entry point routed those internal commands to the CLI parser instead of the daemons. They're now dispatched correctly. (Source installs via bun/npm were unaffected.)

## [0.17.10] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Binary installs now self-upgrade in-app** — PPM installed from a GitHub release binary (not just bun/npm) can upgrade from the UI Upgrade button and `ppm upgrade`, on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It downloads the matching release archive, verifies its SHA-256 against a published `SHA256SUMS` manifest before touching anything, then atomically swaps the binary and its `web/` assets and restarts. A mismatched or missing checksum aborts the upgrade and leaves the running install untouched. Windows renames the locked `.exe` aside and cleans up the leftover on the next start.

### Changed
- **Release now publishes `SHA256SUMS`** — `scripts/release.sh` generates a checksum manifest covering every archive and uploads it to the GitHub release, required by the binary self-upgrade integrity check. Note: upgrading *from* a pre-checksum binary release requires a one-time manual reinstall.

## [0.17.9] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Cloudflare Tunnels moved to a sidebar tab** — the Tunnels panel now lives as a sidebar tool tab (desktop rail + mobile drawer) instead of the bottom dock, redesigned for the narrow column with an initial-load spinner and a manual refresh button that bypasses the 2s server cache. Saved 0.17.8 layouts migrate automatically.
- **Richer mobile tab switcher** — chat rows now show the session tag color as a left accent bar, typing dots while the session is streaming, and an unread dot when a background chat has activity. Added a Default/Recent sort toggle (persisted) and a Rename action for chat tabs.

### Fixed
- **Chat history no longer opens duplicate tabs** — clicking a session in the sidebar (or history bar) now focuses the already-open tab for that session instead of spawning a second copy, including sessions that began as "New Chat".
- **Chat search prioritizes titles** — sidebar search now surfaces title matches first (they're no longer starved out by a flood of message-content matches) and ranks them above content matches.
- **Mobile bottom sheet scrolling** — scrolling back up from the bottom of a sheet's list no longer dismisses it; the swipe-to-dismiss gesture only engages when the list is already at the top.
- **Mobile bottom sheet stays above the keyboard** — sheets now track the visual viewport so they ride above the on-screen keyboard instead of hiding behind it.
- **Mobile current-tab button** — the switcher button shows the active grid tab even when the dock is focused, instead of falling back to "New Tab".
- **Terminal keyboard on tap (mobile)** — tapping the terminal reliably opens the on-screen keyboard (focus now fires on a real touch gesture that xterm doesn't swallow).

## [0.17.8] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **Cloudflare Tunnels panel** — a new dock panel (Ctrl/Cmd+K → "Cloudflare Tunnels") lists every `cloudflared` tunnel running on the machine: PPM-started tunnels, the app share tunnel, and external ones started elsewhere — each with live status and its public `trycloudflare.com` URL (recovered best-effort via cloudflared's metrics endpoint, shown as "unknown" when unavailable). Forward any localhost port to a public URL, and stop tunnels from the panel — external ones ask for confirmation, and the app/supervisor share tunnel is shown locked and can't be stopped from here. Replaces the old per-port "Port Forwarding" tab.

### Fixed
- **Tunnels panel no longer flickers to empty** — a transient Windows process-enumeration timeout previously blanked the whole list; it now serves the last known tunnels on such a hiccup and caches each tunnel's recovered URL per process, removing the repeated system calls that triggered the stall.

## [0.17.7] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **First project switch no longer crashes** — switching to a project for the first time could blank the screen with a React "maximum update depth" error, caused by an unstable store snapshot in the panel layout while the project's workspace was still loading. The layout now returns a stable value during that window, and only the active project's layout recovers a genuinely empty grid.
- **Smoother terminal typing on iOS** — the terminal skips the WebGL renderer on touch devices (it throttled a small canvas and caused per-keystroke lag) and tapping the terminal now reliably opens the on-screen keyboard.
- **Database filter clearing** — clearing column filters resets the grid back to the base table view, and the reload button re-runs whatever view is showing (custom query, filtered, or base table).

### Added
- **Close button on mobile dock tabs** — dock tabs can be closed directly from the mobile dock header.

## [0.17.6] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **Tunnel no longer leaks orphaned cloudflared processes on regeneration** — `restartTunnel()` nulls the mutable global `tunnelChild` before spawning a fresh loop, but a concurrent `spawnTunnel` loop still awaited `tunnelChild.exited` on that global. When it was nulled mid-await the loop threw `TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'tunnelChild.exited')` and died **without reaping the cloudflared child it spawned** — leaving an orphaned process (PID 1) that retried forever. Over weeks dozens accumulated (observed 62 such crashes in one deployment). `spawnTunnel` now owns its child via a local reference for the whole loop and only touches the global while it still points at that child, so a regeneration can never crash the previous loop or orphan its process.
- **Tunnel regeneration no longer trips Cloudflare's per-IP rate limit** — the resume-from-sleep detector regenerated the quick tunnel on *every* wall-clock gap >90s. A laptop that sleeps/wakes frequently rotated the tunnel hundreds of times/day (observed ~325 in 3 weeks), each spawning a new `cloudflared` → trycloudflare rate-limited the source IP and **no new tunnel could register** (`control stream encountered a failure while serving`, retrying forever). Regeneration is now throttled to at most once per 5 minutes; the existing tunnel probe still heals a genuinely-zombied URL, and cloudflared self-heals transient QUIC drops on its own.

## [0.17.5] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **Tunnel no longer resets repeatedly / leaks cloudflared processes** — the supervisor's `spawnTunnel` loop could run multiple times concurrently (a restart or zombie-regeneration started a new loop while the old one respawned itself after its child was killed), spawning duplicate `cloudflared` processes that were never reaped. Over time dozens of orphans accumulated, saturating the network and false-triggering zombie regeneration, which rotated the public trycloudflare URL. A monotonic generation token now guarantees only the newest tunnel loop survives, and a startup sweep reaps orphaned `cloudflared` processes (POSIX).

## [0.17.4] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Agents in the slash picker** — typing `/` now lists your subagents (with a Bot icon) next to skills and commands, reversing the earlier decision to hide them. Selecting an agent adds a removable chip to the composer instead of raw text; when you send, the message is composed as "Use the *agent* agent to …" so the model delegates through the Task tool, and your message bubble shows the agent back as a chip.

### Fixed
- **Slash picker no longer overflows horizontally** — long agent descriptions and command names are now clamped/wrapped so the dropdown stays within the composer width.

## [0.17.3] - 2026-07-15

### Changed
- **Sidebar rail tabs now toggle collapse** — clicking the active section's rail icon collapses the sidebar, and clicking any icon while collapsed re-opens it, so the rail behaves as a proper toggle.

### Fixed
- **Chat History unread badge is now per-project** — the rail badge counts unread sessions for the currently open project only, instead of across all projects (the bottom notification bell keeps the global count).

## [0.17.2] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **License changed from MIT to Elastic License 2.0** — PPM is now source-available under ELv2. You may use, copy, modify, and self-host it, but may not offer it to third parties as a hosted or managed service. Versions published earlier under MIT keep their original terms.

### Fixed
- **Zombie-port reaper handles Git bash path indirection** — the Windows supervisor now resolves indirect bash paths when reaping stale ports.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **AI Resources sidebar panel** — a new ✨ section (rail + mobile drawer) to browse and manage your skills, agents, and commands in one place, across Project, User, and bundled scopes. Each row shows its scope and flags override/shadow relationships (which same-named resource wins and which is inactive), so the multi-root precedence is finally visible. Search, type filters (Skills / Agents / Commands / MCP), and a context menu (Open, Duplicate, Delete — long-press on mobile) round it out.
- **AI resource editor** — opening a resource launches an editor tab with raw markdown editing, Save/Revert, and Ctrl/⌘+S. Bundled resources are read-only with a "duplicate to edit" path; a banner warns when the resource is shadowed by a higher-priority one. Create new skills/agents/commands from templates into a chosen scope, or duplicate an existing one under a new name.
- **Agent discovery** — subagents under `agents/` (`.claude`, `.ppm`, …) are now discovered and parsed (model + tools). They surface in the AI Resources panel but are intentionally kept out of the slash-command picker (agents are not slash-invokable).
- **Session history sidebar with full-text chat search** — a new Chat History panel lists prior sessions and searches across transcripts, backed by a dedicated search index.

### Changed
- **MCP servers moved from Settings into the AI Resources panel** — manage (add / edit / delete / import from Claude Code) MCP servers from the same place as your other AI resources instead of the Settings tab. The MCP server dialog is unchanged.
- **Shared sidebar panel header** — explorer, git, database, and jira panels now use a common header component for consistency.

## [0.16.10] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **The status-bar version chip now always opens the release-notes popover** — previously it only reacted when an update was available. Clicking it with no update pending shows your recent releases (via a new "recent changelog" fetch); when an update is available it behaves as before (upgrade action + "Later").

### Fixed
- **Newest release notes no longer go missing right after a release** — the CHANGELOG fetch is now cache-busted with a timestamp query, so GitHub's raw CDN can't serve a stale copy that lags the npm version signal.

## [0.16.9] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- **Chat transcript is no longer virtualized** — replaced the TanStack virtualizer and its hand-rolled scroll physics (size estimates, banked scroll corrections, pin/interact guards) with plain DOM rendering plus `use-stick-to-bottom`. Content growing below the viewport now physically cannot move your scroll position (native browser behavior), which root-causes both long-standing scroll bugs. Measured on a 200-message session: p95 frame time 31ms → 19ms, 6× fewer layout passes, scroll CPU unchanged, at the cost of ~50MB extra heap.

### Fixed
- **Scrolling up to read during streaming no longer keeps yanking you back down** — follow-to-bottom now releases on any upward scroll and only re-engages when you return to the bottom yourself.
- **Returning to a chat tab mid-stream no longer jumps to the bottom** — hidden tabs are 0-height (display:none), which made the stick-to-bottom lock silently re-engage while you were away; the follow intent is now captured only while the panel is visible and re-asserted on reshow, so the spot you were reading is kept.

### Added
- **Session debug popup with weight metrics** — the bug icon in the chat toolbar now opens a dialog (bottom sheet on mobile) instead of copying immediately, with a Copy button. Besides session IDs and the JSONL path it now reports how heavy the session is: JSONL size + record count, rendered message count, transcript DOM nodes, transcript height, and JS heap.

## [0.16.8] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- **"Buy me a coffee" dialog now points to a working payment destination** — the Wise link used a placeholder Wisetag and the VietQR image was a placeholder. The dialog now links to the real Wise payment link and shows the actual Techcombank VietQR with the account holder name (LE HONG HIEN) below it so supporters can confirm the recipient.

## [0.16.7] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed
- **Git graph no longer hijacks another project's panel across browser tabs** — opening the git graph for a second project in a new tab disposed and took over the first project's panel. The extension host now keeps one panel per project (keyed by project path), `webview:create` carries the project path/name, and clients only rebind tabs on a project match (ignoring broadcast creates they didn't request).

### Changed
- **Default cloud domain moved to the `cloud.ppm.sh` subdomain** (root `ppm.sh` reserved for marketing).

## [0.16.6] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Reloading after an upgrade no longer locks you out** — the "Reload" button fired an immediate page reload while the supervisor was still restarting the server, so the browser landed on a dead server and its native error page (no JS left to auto-recover), leaving you stuck until a manual reload once the server finished booting. The button now polls `/api/health` until the upgraded server responds (60s cap) and shows a "Waiting for server…" spinner before reloading.

### Changed
- **Default cloud domain updated to `ppm.sh`.**

## [0.16.5] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Redesigned login screen** — accent glow backdrop, password visibility toggle, live tunnel status chip (via a new read-only `tunnel_active` field on `/api/info`), and footer links: GitHub repo, bug report, and a "Buy me a coffee" support dialog (VietQR bank transfer + Wise international link; bottom sheet on mobile).

### Fixed
- **Scrolling up through a long conversation no longer flashes/jerks** — rows measured above the viewport made the virtualizer compensate `scrollTop` one frame before their new offsets committed, so content visibly shoved down and snapped back on every row entry. The compensation is now banked and applied in the same pre-paint frame as the new offsets (atomic, invisible). Also removed the repeatable reflow sources that triggered it constantly: message images are cached (blob + rendered size) across virtualization remounts instead of refetching and regrowing every time, code blocks highlight synchronously from a warm Shiki cache so they render at final height on first paint, and the Edit-diff chunk preloads at startup instead of on the first Edit card.

## [0.16.4] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Streaming no longer stops following the bottom after a wheel/touch at the end of the transcript** — a gesture made while already scrolled to the bottom produces no scroll event, so the "interacting" guard never cleared and the pin-to-bottom snap stayed suppressed (new streamed content grew below the fold). The guard now self-clears once the gesture goes quiet.
- **Sending a message while a question/approval was pending no longer hangs the turn** — the pending AskUserQuestion/approval is now auto-resolved as skipped first, unblocking the tool generator so the follow-up message flows through and persists instead of being lost.
- **Switching to a project whose workspace lived only in the DB no longer restores an empty tab list** — project switch read localStorage only; it now fetches and merges the server workspace before switching when no local copy exists (projects opened on another device/tunnel, or after a cache wipe).

## [0.16.3] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Upgrade button in the status bar** shows the latest version ("New version · vX.Y.Z") and opens a popover that loads the actual release notes (CHANGELOG entries between the installed and latest version). Also mirrored in the mobile drawer footer.

### Fixed
- **Upgrade prompt no longer shows a reversed/downgrade** — the button only appears when the reported version is strictly newer than the installed one.
- **Release notes wrap long tokens** and no longer produce a horizontal scrollbar.
- **All floating dropdowns/popovers are now fully opaque** on glass themes (Aurora) — the translucent popover surface is composited over a solid base instead of reading as see-through (project switcher, model/provider/mode selectors, session picker, team activity, DB column menu, path suggestions, and shadcn menus).

## [0.16.2] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- **AskUserQuestion rendered as two cards per question** — the interactive `approval_request` card and the SDK's real `tool_use`/`tool_result` both rendered. The SDK pair is now suppressed on the client; the approval card (which carries the selected answers) is the single representation.
- **Answering a question on one device didn't dismiss it on others** — the server now broadcasts `approval_resolved` on every approval response; all connected clients clear the live prompt and converge to the answered card (previously only the answering client cleared, and late answers were silent no-ops).
- **Reloading a session mid-turn duplicated the active turn** — REST history (JSONL persists the turn incrementally) and the `turn_events` replay both delivered the unfinished turn. The replay is now authoritative: it strips the history copy of the active turn, and the initial history merge trims it when a replay already owns it.
- **Duplicate events from overlapping reconnect replays** (same session in two tabs / reconnect churn) — a new `turn_events` replay cancels the previous replay's rAF chunking, and id-bearing events (`approval_request` by requestId, `tool_use`/`tool_result` by toolUseId) upsert in place instead of appending duplicates.

### Changed
- **Mobile drawer footer** now hosts the upgrade/version button (same popover as desktop status bar, left-aligned) instead of a static version label.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-07-11

### Changed
- **Edit/MultiEdit diff preview** now shows a Monaco-style inline diff: unchanged context lines render neutral, changed lines are interleaved (removed above added), and only the exact changed words/characters are highlighted on top of syntax colors — instead of tinting the whole old and new blocks. Uses jsdiff line/word diffing merged with highlight.js output.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **VSCode-style theme engine** — themes are data objects applied as CSS variables at runtime, so switching is instant with no reload. Ships 6 built-ins (Aurora / Slate / Precision × dark/light) selectable via a status-bar palette picker and a 2-column theme grid in Settings; `system` mode follows the OS. Aurora is a glass/gradient default.
- **Surface adapters** — Monaco, xterm, and the Glide data grid recolor from the active theme; chat code blocks now use **Shiki** (streaming-safe, theme-aware) in place of highlight.js.
- **Import VSCode themes** — paste JSON, a raw URL, or a Marketplace `.vsix` and it converts to a PPM theme that lights up chrome + editor + terminal + code blocks. Server-side import is hardened against SSRF, zip-slip, zip-bombs, and CSS-injection; imported themes are managed (apply/rename/delete) in Settings.
- **Status-bar git** — branch · ahead/behind · synced indicators for the active project.

### Changed
- **Full desktop restyle** to the new design language: gradient app backdrop, glass sidebar/rail, 41px chrome rhythm (tab bar aligns with the sidebar header), top-accent active tabs with dividers, redesigned chat composer (chip row + inline input), token-driven Explorer tree, and a 26px mono status bar scoped to the working area.
- **Theme persistence** moved to a `{style, mode}` model; legacy `light|dark|system` values migrate automatically on load.
- **Upgrade prompt** moved from the top banner into a status-bar button with an update popover (Update now / Release notes / Later).

## [0.15.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **`Mod+'` now toggles the terminal panel** (opens/closes the dock, auto-opening a terminal when empty) instead of creating a terminal tab. "Open Terminal Tab" keeps no default shortcut and remains available via the command palette.

### Fixed
- **Dock resize lost its grip on the first drag** — `onResize` fed the live dock height into the Panel's mount-only `defaultSize`, so react-resizable-panels re-baselined the panel mid-drag (2nd drag worked). `defaultSize` is now frozen per layout key and refreshes only on maximize/restore/position change.
- **Toggling the terminal panel jumped scrolled chat tabs to the top** — the toggle switched the whole layout between a bare grid and a wrapped group, remounting the grid and reparenting its tabs via TabPool. The Group is now always rendered with the grid Panel at a fixed child slot; only the dock Panel + handle are added/removed, so the grid never remounts.
- **Mobile tab-switcher sheet couldn't scroll** — the tab list is a flex child; without `min-h-0` it wouldn't shrink below its content, so `overflow-y-auto` never engaged. Added `min-h-0` (+ `overscroll-contain`).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Mobile bottom nav v2** — the horizontal scrolling tab strip is replaced by a single **current-tab button** that opens a searchable **tab-switcher bottom sheet** grouped by split panel (per-row activate/close, long-press for the full tab action menu). The `+` opens the command palette; a dedicated **Terminal button** (green dot when sessions are running) toggles the dock sheet with expand/collapse (60%↔92%).
- **Generalized panel dock** — the former "terminal dock" is now a position-configurable panel that can sit **left / bottom / right** (VS Code style) via a header dropdown (persisted per user). New header: pill strip (icon per tab type, `+N` overflow on vertical layouts), position dropdown, maximize/restore, hide, and per-pill close. The dock **never shows an empty state**: opening an empty dock auto-opens a terminal, and closing the last terminal auto-hides the dock.
- **Desktop status bar** — a 22px bottom bar (previously defined but never mounted) now hosts the **only** panel toggle (`PanelBottom` + open-tab count, primary tint when open), plus CPU/MEM (moved from the sidebar) and the app version.

### Changed
- Sidebar drops the version line under the wordmark and the CPU/MEM resource strip; the nav rail and tab bar drop their terminal-dock toggles — the status bar owns the sole toggle.

### Fixed
- **Re-dock into an empty dock got stuck** — closing the last terminal *from the dock* deleted the reserved `__dock__` panel (the empty-panel auto-close was missing a `!== DOCK_PANEL_ID` guard). A later grid-terminal close then re-docked into a missing panel: the terminal stayed stuck in the editor while an empty dock opened. The dock panel is now never deleted.
- **Dock position change could remount/kill the terminal** — desktop dock maximize/position changes now re-apply size via a keyed group remount (react-resizable-panels `defaultSize` is mount-only); the live xterm lives in the tab pool and is reparented, so the PTY survives.

## [0.14.26] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Janky mobile scroll + dead nav buttons in chat** — the app-owned stick-to-bottom snapped `scrollTop = scrollHeight` from a ResizeObserver on every content-height change, including while the user was mid-swipe (the virtualizer re-measures rows as they scroll in), so touch scrolling fought the finger — jerky, sluggish, and the ▲/▼ jump buttons got yanked back. The snap now runs only when the user is not interacting (an `interacting` flag spanning touch/wheel until scrolling settles ~200ms), pin state is derived from observed scroll position + gesture direction instead of forced, and the container gets `overscroll-behavior: contain` + momentum scrolling.

## [0.14.25] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Terminal dock panel** — a collapsible bottom dock (toggle with `Ctrl+\``, VSCode parity) that holds terminal and system-monitor tabs separately from the editor grid. Closing a terminal from a grid panel now re-docks (parks) it instead of killing the session, and dock state + tabs persist across reloads and are kept alive by the tab pool. Stored layouts without a dock field migrate to sane defaults.
- **Editor language picker + New DB Query** — new/open files gain a language dropdown to override the Monaco language (JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, JSON, XML, HTML, CSS, Python, Markdown, YAML, Shell). Choosing SQL activates the existing connection picker, autocomplete, inline `▷ Run`/`Ctrl+Enter`, and results panel — no `.sql` file required. A new **New DB Query** command in the palette opens a blank SQL scratchpad.

### Fixed
- **Terminal idle timeout counted while connected** — the idle timer ran even with a live WebSocket attached, risking premature session kills. The timer now upholds a strict invariant (armed iff `ws === null`): paused on connect, re-armed on disconnect, and never re-armed by activity while connected.
- **Supervisor tunnel/health check used the stale startup port** — after a zombie-port fallback moved the server, tunnel respawns and the server health check still targeted the original config port, split-braining the tunnel and killing a healthy server every cycle. Both now follow the server's live port (`_opts.port`).

## [0.14.24] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Tunnel URL rotated on every upgrade (Windows)** — tunnel adoption across upgrade worked, but daemonized chat-tool debris (agent-browser + its headless-chrome tree, msys coreutils from bash tools) inherited the server's listening-socket handle and escaped both `taskkill /T` and the tracked-descendant snapshot (their parent link broke before any snapshot ran). The port stayed in zombie LISTENING state owned by a dead PID, forcing a port fallback → tunnel restart → new random trycloudflare URL. The supervisor now: (1) hunts orphaned debris holding the zombie port — dead-parent processes matching a narrow whitelist, killed by exact PID, cloudflared always protected — before falling back to another port; (2) persists the tunnel's origin port (`tunnelPort` in status.json) and binds the server to the **adopted tunnel's port** instead of the configured one, restarting the tunnel only on a real origin mismatch; (3) adopts the tunnel before spawning the server so port selection sees adoption state.

## [0.14.23] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Chat tab crash: `scrollToEnd is not a function`** — the virtualized message list called `@tanstack/react-virtual` APIs that don't exist in any published release (`scrollToEnd()`, and the `anchorTo`/`followOnAppend`/`scrollEndThreshold` options — latest published is 3.14.5, not the assumed 3.16/3.17). `scrollToEnd()` threw on render and blanked the chat tab; the options were silently ignored. Scroll-to-bottom now uses the component's own pin-to-bottom invariant (`scrollTop = scrollHeight`), which already handled sticking, streaming follow, and jump-to-newest. Removed the dead options and the guarded `isAtEnd()` dead branch.

## [0.14.22] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Disabled accounts silently expired** — disabling an account stopped both its token auto-refresh and its usage-limit polling. With no refresh, the access token lapsed and the rotating OAuth refresh token eventually went stale server-side, so the account became a dead "temporary" account that could no longer be re-enabled. Disable now only removes an account from the chat rotation: background token refresh and usage polling keep running (neither consumes quota), so the account stays alive and re-enabling always works.

## [0.14.21] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Virtualized chat list scroll follow-ups (0.14.20 regressions)** — three fixes to the new virtualized message list:
  - *Thinking/processing indicator hidden during streaming* — the indicator + approval card now ride as a trailing virtual row whose key embeds the message count; virtual-core only fires `followOnAppend` when the last item's key changes, so the previous constant key suppressed scroll-to-end for every mid-turn append.
  - *Fresh load landed short of the bottom* — Suspense skeletons for the lazy markdown renderer resolved after mount and grew each message, pushing the transcript tail out of view. The markdown chunk is now prefetched at module load, and an app-owned stick-to-bottom (ResizeObserver snap to real `scrollHeight` while pinned) absorbs any late growth. The pin releases only on user intent (wheel up / touch drag / scrollbar drag), never on the virtualizer's own programmatic adjustments.
  - *Bottom-pin listeners never attached* — the scroll container mounts after the "Loading messages…" early return, so mount-time effects saw a null ref; a callback ref now re-attaches them when the list actually appears.

## [0.14.20] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- **Chat tab memory bloat on long sessions** — a busy session tab held ~17K DOM nodes and ~1GB of renderer memory. Windowing only capped the *initial* render; scrolling up or expanding compact history grew the list unbounded and every rendered bubble stayed mounted, so hundreds of markdown + syntax-highlighted code blocks kept their layout/paint trees alive (invisible to `performance.memory`, which read only ~183MB JS heap). The message list is now virtualized with `@tanstack/react-virtual` (`anchorTo: 'end'` + `followOnAppend`, upgraded to pull virtual-core 3.17), so only on-screen bubbles live in the DOM. This replaces the `use-stick-to-bottom` wrapper while preserving stick-to-bottom, streaming pin, history-prepend anchoring, and the ▲/▼ message navigation.

## [0.14.19] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **Repeated "Token refreshed — retrying" on shared accounts** — Anthropic revokes the previous access token on every OAuth refresh, and each chat session freezes its token into a long-lived SDK subprocess. When one account was shared across concurrent sessions/instances, each session's 401-recovery refresh revoked the token the others held, bouncing the 401 back and looping token refreshes (observed twice in 8 minutes on a token with hours of life left). 401 recovery now adopts a token already refreshed in the DB by another session instead of forcing a redundant refresh, breaking the cascade.

## [0.14.18] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **External-file breadcrumb browsing** — the editor breadcrumb dropdown now works for files opened outside the project root. Previously it queried the project-scoped file API with paths that live outside the project, so every request 404'd and the dropdown spun on "Loading…" forever. External files now browse the real filesystem via `/api/fs/browse` (handles POSIX and Windows paths).
- **Terminal survives suspend/sleep** — a slept/suspended WebSocket keeps reporting `OPEN` while actually dead, silently dropping input. The terminal now runs a PING/PONG heartbeat and forces a reconnect when the socket goes silent (zombie-socket detection), also re-checking on tab focus.

### Added
- **Mobile tab long-press menu** — the mobile tab menu gains **Select for Compare** / **Compare with Selected**, **Mark as unread** and **Set Tag** (for chat sessions), and **Close Others** / **Close to the Right**, matching the desktop tab bar.

## [0.14.17] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- **Supervisor self-heals after hibernate/resume** — on resume a previous server's orphaned child can hold the listening socket via an inherited handle Windows won't release ("zombie port"), making the server crash-loop on `EADDRINUSE` until it hit the restart cap and paused. The supervisor now resolves a bindable port before each spawn (reaping orphans, reclaiming a stale PPM holder, and falling back to a nearby free port) and re-points the tunnel at the new origin, so the backend stays up instead of pausing.

### Added
- **Resume-from-sleep detection** — the supervisor detects the wall-clock gap left by hibernate/sleep and resets the server/tunnel restart budgets, unpauses if needed, and regenerates the cloudflared quick tunnel (its QUIC link and `*.trycloudflare.com` DNS record die on resume → `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`), self-healing to a working URL instead of staying dark.

## [0.14.16] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **Terminal session persistence across browser backgrounding** — WS disconnect grace extended from 2min to 30min so PTY survives macOS tab discarding/Safari throttling; output buffer increased from 200KB to 1MB; idle timer now resets on PTY output (running processes keep session alive); xterm scrollback increased from 1K to 50K lines; reconnect clears terminal before buffer replay to prevent duplicates; resize observer skips hidden tabs to avoid PTY resize to 0×0

### Added
- **Editor manual reload** — toolbar refresh button re-fetches file content from disk when filesystem watch misses a change
- **Codex edit session reuse** — fork/edit reuses the source session's live app-server instead of cold-spawning a new one (~10s faster)

## [0.14.15] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **Intermittent 401 auth errors on chat** — background OAuth auto-refresh timer could revoke the token between the pre-flight freshness check and subprocess launch, causing a race where the subprocess was given an already-revoked token. Token is now re-read from DB immediately before launch, closing the race window.

## [0.14.14] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- **Background command bar + viewable `.output`** — SDK background commands (Bash `run_in_background`) now surface in a bar pinned at the top of the chat showing each running command with a live indicator, a **View output** button (opens a panel that tails the command's `.output` file, polling while it runs), and a **Stop** button (asks the agent to call `KillShell`). The bar clears automatically when a command finishes (driven by the SDK `task_notification`/`task_updated` completion events) or is stopped. Clicking a command's `.output` pill in chat now opens the same panel instead of failing — `.output` is recognized as a viewable file and resolved to its absolute path served via `/api/fs/read`. Claude provider only.
- **Manual "mark as unread" on chat sessions** — chat sessions can be flagged unread from the session list.

### Fixed
- **Edit-message versioning, timestamps, and titles** — editing a message now versions correctly, preserves timestamps, and keeps the session title.

### Changed
- **Edit shows a "Creating edited version…" overlay** — editing a message now shows a working overlay during the fork + reconnect instead of an optimistic message echo (which could render in the wrong place); the real message appears once the forked session loads.
- **Dev tooling** — added tunnel scripts and made the Vite dev proxy target env-overridable (`PPM_DEV_API`).

## [0.14.13] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed
- **Mermaid preview no longer leaks "Syntax error" bombs** — when a Mermaid code block had invalid syntax (e.g. incomplete diagrams during AI streaming), `mermaid.render()` injected an error "bomb" SVG into the DOM and threw; the swallowed error left those orphaned error graphics stacked at the bottom of the page. The renderer now validates with `mermaid.parse(..., { suppressErrors: true })` before rendering (parse never touches the DOM) and defensively removes any orphaned render node, so invalid diagrams cleanly fall back to a plain code block.
- **Fork/edit no longer resets chat title to "Forked Chat"** — forking a chat or editing a message overrode the SDK-inherited summary and dropped any user-set title. The fork now inherits the source's title.

## [0.14.12] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- **Account rotation on rate limit no longer hangs** — when an account hit a rate limit, the provider could keep retrying the *same* exhausted account with an escalating 15s→30s→60s backoff (≈105s of dead waiting) whenever the other account was unavailable, and ping-pong between two already-limited accounts until the shared retry budget burned out. Rate limits now **switch to a genuinely different account** (tracked per-turn so each account is tried at most once) and retry immediately with no backoff; if no alternate account is available it **fails fast** with a clear "All accounts are rate limited" message instead of looping. `server_error` (5xx) is split out to keep its same-account backoff retry. Applied to both the assistant-error and result-level 429 paths.

### Added
- **Cooldown parking is now optional (default off)** — failing accounts (rate limit / usage limit / auth error / preflight refresh fail) are no longer parked in a cooldown by default; account rotation still proactively skips accounts at ≥95% of their 5-hour limit (based on real usage), and per-turn exclusion prevents re-hammering a failing account within a request, so the artificial cooldown lockout mostly just blocked otherwise-usable accounts. A new **Cooldown** toggle in the chat "Rotation & Retry" dialog and Settings → Accounts (config key `account_cooldown_enabled`, `PUT /api/accounts/settings`) restores the parking behavior when enabled.

## [0.14.11] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **Upgrade tunnel diagnostics** — the supervisor now logs the tunnel hand-off and adoption decision around a self-replace upgrade, so a Windows-only case where the public `trycloudflare` URL changes after upgrade can be traced from `ppm.log` on the next occurrence. New lines: the tunnel pid/url handed to the new supervisor, whether the kept-alive tunnel was still alive pre-upgrade, the new supervisor's startup `isUpgrade`/`prevState`/preserved pid+url, and an explicit adopted (URL preserved) vs FRESH tunnel (URL will change) decision. No behavior change.

## [0.14.10] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **Mobile project switcher reaches desktop parity** — the mobile project bottom sheet gains the features that previously only existed in the desktop flyout: a **search** field (filter by name/path), a **sort selector** (Recent / Priority / Name, sharing the server-synced `projectSortMode`), per-row **recent open-time** labels, and **Open in New Tab** + **Copy Path** actions in the long-press action sheet. Move Up/Down reorder is now scoped to Priority mode with no active search (matching desktop drag rules). Sort logic (`applySort` + `SORT_OPTIONS`) is extracted into a shared `project-sort.ts` used by both the desktop and mobile switchers.

## [0.14.9] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Custom project avatars** — set any project's avatar to an image uploaded from the client. Right-click a project in the switcher (or long-press in the mobile bottom-sheet) → **Change Image**; the picked file is center-cropped to a square and downscaled to a 128×128 webp in the browser, then uploaded. Images are stored content-addressed at `~/.ppm/avatars/<sha256>.webp` and served via `GET /api/projects/:name/image` with an immutable cache header. A custom image overrides the initials+color circle everywhere (switcher, mobile-nav, bottom-sheet) via a new shared `ProjectAvatar` component; **Remove Image** reverts to color+initials. Avatar files are cleaned up on project delete, deduped on upload, and preserved across rename. New `avatar-storage.service.ts`, `resize-image.ts`, store actions `setProjectImage`/`removeProjectImage`, and 9 route tests.

### Fixed
- **Rename no longer wipes project color/avatar** — `projectService.update()` rebuilt the entry as `{path,name}` only, silently dropping `color` (and now `image`) on rename/path change; it now preserves all existing fields.

## [0.14.8] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **Project switcher prefs sync across devices/tunnels** — the sort mode and the recently-opened timestamps are now persisted server-side (in the shared UI-prefs blob) instead of localStorage-only. On startup `hydrateUiPrefs()` pulls the server copy and rebuilds the local recent-order cache, so opening PPM on a fresh browser/device/tunnel reflects your last sort choice and recent-open history. New `projectSortMode` + `recentOpen` UI-pref validators (`settings.ts`); writes go to `PUT /api/settings/ui-prefs` on selection.
- **Larger project switcher flyout** — widened to 340px and raised the max height to 680px for easier scanning of longer project lists.

## [0.14.7] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Codex account portability (encrypted export/import)** — back up and move Codex logins between machines (parity with Claude accounts backup). The portable unit per account is its `CODEX_HOME/auth.json` plus any stored apiKey creds, bundled and encrypted with a user password (PBKDF2 + AES, shared `encryptWithPassword` scheme). New `codex-account-portability.ts` with `exportCodexEncrypted` / `importCodexEncrypted` (import skips ids that already exist — no clobber), exposed via `POST /api/codex-accounts/export` (downloads an encrypted blob) and `POST /api/codex-accounts/import`, with export/import controls in the Codex usage panel and Settings → Codex Accounts.
- **Project switcher sort modes** — the project dropdown can now sort by **Recent** (most-recently-opened, now tracked on selection), **Priority** (manual drag order), or **Name** (alphabetical); the choice persists across sessions. Drag-to-reorder is scoped to Priority mode.
- **Open project in new browser tab** — each row in the project switcher has an open-in-new-tab action (also in the right-click menu) that opens `/project/{name}` in a new tab.
- **Keyboard navigation in project search** — ↑/↓ move the highlight, Enter opens the highlighted project (defaults to the first match), Ctrl/Cmd+Enter opens it in a new tab, Esc closes.

## [0.14.6] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Codex (OpenAI) chat provider** — PPM's 3rd chat provider, implementing `AIProvider` directly against `codex app-server` over newline-delimited JSON-RPC (stdio). Delivers token-by-token streaming, multi-turn in one live session (`pushMessage` → `turn/start` multiplexed over a single notification stream), subprocess lifecycle (abort SIGTERM→SIGKILL + Windows `killProcessTree`, `cleanupAll` on shutdown), resume + sidebar history (rollout JSONL parser with a fail-closed cwd filter so cross-project transcripts never leak), and a model picker (`model/list`, paginated, TTL-cached). Approval mode reuses PPM's existing `permissionMode` (mapped to codex `{sandbox, approvalPolicy}`); the inbound approval / ask-user-input bridge is protocol-correct but dormant under the default `bypassPermissions` (Full access). Registers only when the scoped `@openai/codex` binary resolves (`codex login` required); PPM never manages Codex auth. New code under `src/providers/codex-app-server/`; removed the unused `@openai/codex-sdk` devDependency.
- **Codex multi-account** — manage multiple Codex logins (parity with Claude accounts). Each account owns its own `CODEX_HOME` dir (`~/.ppm/codex-accounts/<id>`, 0700) where the app-server writes `auth.json`; PPM spawns the app-server with the resolved home per session rather than holding tokens itself. Headless add via OpenAI API key (instant) or ChatGPT device-code (long-poll). Per-session account selection — sticky `codex_account_id` on session metadata → strategy (round-robin / fill-first / lowest-usage) → default `~/.codex`. Stored credentials are encrypted with the shared `~/.ppm/account.key` scheme. New `codex-account.service.ts`, `codex-account-login.ts`, `/api/codex-accounts` routes, and a Settings → Codex Accounts panel.
- **Codex quota / usage** — per-account 5-hour and weekly utilization via `account/rateLimits/read` (`parseCodexUsage`), surfaced through the provider's `getUsage()`.
- **Codex usage badge in chat toolbar** — Codex sessions now show the `5h:%·Wk:%` badge like Claude; clicking it opens a Codex accounts panel (per-account usage, add/remove, selection strategy) directly in the chat.

### Changed
- **Codex tool rendering** — exhaustive tool-call mapping so no Codex tool invocation is hidden; file edits render as Edit/Write and persist across history reloads.

## [0.14.5] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- **`ppm restart` self-heals an orphaned daemon after sleep/crash**: on Windows the Bun supervisor (and its job-object server child) can die on resume from hibernate while the detached cloudflared tunnel survives, leaving a half-alive daemon that `status.json` still names. `ppm restart` previously dead-ended with "Supervisor not running. Use 'ppm stop && ppm start'", forcing a manual two-step recovery. It now detects the dead supervisor, tears down the orphan tunnel + stale state (`stopServer({ kill: true })`), and starts a fresh daemon on the same port (`restart.ts`).

## [0.14.4] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Editor tab bar styles (Default / Boxed / Pill)**: new `editorTabStyle` UI preference (persisted + synced) selectable in Settings → Tab Style. Boxed and Pill render each tab as an independent bordered/filled shape so wrapped rows (Wrap Tabs) stay clean. Shared className recipes live in `tab-bar-style.ts`; `draggable-tab.tsx` and `tab-bar.tsx` read the chosen style (`settings-store.ts`, `settings.ts`).
- **Git panel split commit button**: VSCode-style primary `Commit (N)` + caret dropdown (Commit & Push, Commit & Sync, Amend Last Commit, Push, Pull, Fetch). Amend support added to the commit service/route (`git.service.ts`, `git.ts`).

### Changed
- **Unified navigation rail (sidebar redesign)**: the standalone project bar and the horizontal section tab strip merge into one left region — a top bar with the PPM wordmark + project switcher flyout (search, select, add, plus rename/color/delete/reorder via context menu) over a vertical section rail (Explorer/Search/Git/Database/Settings + conditional Jira/extensions) with footer utilities. Collapses to an icon-only rail (`sidebar.tsx`, `project-switcher.tsx`, `nav-section-rail.tsx`; removes `project-bar.tsx`).
- **Git panel commit-on-top**: on desktop the commit block sits directly under the branch header (above worktrees and the file list); mobile keeps it at the bottom. The standalone Push/Pull row is removed (now in the split-button dropdown).
- **Git panel history button opens Git Graph**: the header history button now launches the Git Graph extension (`git-graph.view`), falling back to the built-in Git Log tab when the extension is disabled.

### Fixed
- **Git panel header divider color**: the branch-header `border-b` had no border color (Tailwind v4 defaults to `currentColor`, rendering near-black); now uses `border-border`.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **In-app upgrade failed with "Executable not found in $PATH: bun"**: when PPM is launched via autostart (launchd/systemd), the spawned process does not inherit the shell `$PATH`, so the upgrade installer's bare `bun`/`npm` command could not be resolved. The installer now uses the absolute path of the running runtime (`process.execPath`) for the bun case, and resolves `npm` next to the runtime's bin dir (falling back to the bare name) for the npm case (`upgrade.service.ts`).

### Changed
- **Drop unused `action` prop from `FileActions`**: the component only ever handles delete, so the redundant `action: "delete"` prop was removed from all call sites; `adaptive-context-menu` `useRef` initialized explicitly to satisfy strict typings (`file-actions.tsx`, `file-tree.tsx`, `mobile-nav.tsx`, `tab-bar.tsx`, `adaptive-context-menu.tsx`).

## [0.14.2] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- **Claude SDK subprocess crash on OAuth/subscription accounts with 1M context**: when `context_1m` was enabled the provider always sent the `betas: ["context-1m-2025-08-07"]` header. Beta headers are honored only for API-key auth; OAuth/subscription sessions reject them ("Custom betas are only available for API key users. Ignoring provided betas.") and the subprocess crashed. The header is now sent only when authenticating with an API key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` present); entitled OAuth accounts still get 1M context via the `[1m]` model suffix (`claude-agent-sdk.ts`).
- **Windows port reclamation on restart and self-replace**: a crashed supervisor could leave an orphaned server holding the inherited listening socket, blocking the new server from binding. Startup now tree-kills the tracked supervisor/server/tunnel PIDs from a stale `status.json` before the port check, and when the port is still held it resolves the real listener via `netstat -ano` (`findPortListenerPid`) — an alive stale-PPM holder (`isPpmProcess`) is reclaimed by tree-kill, while a dead-process zombie socket auto-falls back to a nearby free port. The supervisor self-replace handoff applies the same netstat-based holder resolution before spawning its successor (`windows-process-tree.ts`, `index.ts`, `supervisor.ts`).

## [0.14.1] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Inherit MCP servers from Claude Code**: PPM now auto-loads MCP servers configured in Claude Code's `~/.claude.json` (global top-level servers + project-scoped servers matching the session's cwd), so MCP installed via `claude mcp add` works in PPM without re-adding it. Read fresh per query and merged with PPM's own MCP registry, where PPM DB entries override inherited ones on name conflict. Toggle via the new `inherit_claude_mcp` provider flag (default on) exposed as "Inherit Claude Code MCP" in Settings → AI (`claude-code-mcp.service.ts`, `claude-agent-sdk.ts`).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Scheduled Agents (cron scheduler)**: PPM can now periodically wake a Claude session to work on a project unattended. SQLite v31 adds `schedules` + `schedule_runs` (per-job cron expression, project, prompt, permission mode, `max_turns`/`timeout_ms` budgets, snapshot `provider_id`). The in-process scheduler (`scheduler-core.ts`) ticks every 60s with a refcounted concurrency guard that records `skipped` runs when a prior run is still active; `scheduler-runner.ts` keeps one persistent session per job (resume-or-create), drains output into a 32KB head+tail buffer, enforces a wall-clock timeout via `abortQuery`, rotates to a fresh session past 80% context, and sends a Telegram summary through `notificationService.broadcast` (offline-gated). Boot-time hygiene orphans stale `running` rows (>2h) and prunes runs older than 30 days (`scheduler-db.service.ts`).
- **CLI `ppm schedule`**: `add | list | rm | enable | disable | run-now | runs`. `run-now` bypasses the concurrency guard with a `wasRunning` warning.
- **REST `/api/schedules`**: full CRUD + `:id/run-now` + `:id/runs`, with cron and numeric-budget validation.
- **Settings → Scheduled Agents UI**: mobile-first section (bottom-sheet form on mobile, dialog on desktop, long-press adaptive context menu, 44px touch targets), 10s visibility-gated polling, and per-schedule run history with status pills (`src/web/components/settings/schedules/*`).

### Changed
- **Claude SDK provider**: the `done` event now carries `costUsd` (from `total_cost_usd`) and `SendMessageOpts` accepts a per-query `maxTurns` override (falls back to the global provider default). Both additive — existing chat flows are unaffected (`chat.ts`, `claude-agent-sdk.ts`).

## [0.13.113] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- **Windows auto-start now uses Task Scheduler (at-logon)**: the HKCU `Run` key did not reliably launch PPM at logon and is swept by third-party startup-cleaner utilities. `ppm autostart enable` now registers an at-logon scheduled task via `schtasks` (no admin required) that runs the existing hidden VBS launcher, and removes the legacy `Run` key so older installs don't double-launch. `autostart status` reports the Task Scheduler state (`autostart-generator.ts`, `autostart-register.ts`).

## [0.13.112] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Live task tracker in chat**: Claude's `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskStop` calls are now tracked and shown in a pinned, collapsible tracker above the chat scroll area (collapsed by default; auto-hides once every task is completed/stopped; ✓/▶/○ status rows with `N/M done`). Task state is rebuilt on the backend from the full session JSONL via a new endpoint `GET /chat/sessions/:id/tasks` and a pure `aggregateTasks()` fold, so tasks resolve correctly even when the create scrolled out of the frontend's paginated window (`task-status-aggregator.ts`, `chat.ts`, `task-tracker.tsx`, `use-tasks.ts`).
- **Readable inline Task cards**: `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskStop` tool cards now render subject + status badge instead of raw JSON (`tool-cards.tsx`).

### Fixed
- **Windows session-transcript resolution**: `resolveSessionJsonlPath` now replaces all path separators (`/ \ :`) and falls back to scanning `~/.claude/projects/*` for the session transcript, fixing drive-letter/casing mismatches that returned no data on Windows. `validateJsonlPath` now compares paths separator-insensitively, fixing a false "path traversal detected" on Windows that also affected the expand-compact (`/pre-compact-messages`) endpoint (`chat.ts`, `jsonl-transcript-parser.ts`).

## [0.13.111] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **ScheduleWakeup tool card**: chat now renders a dedicated card for the SDK's `ScheduleWakeup` tool — summary row shows a clock icon with the human-readable delay (`30m`, `1m 30s`) and truncated reason; expanded view shows delay, reason, and the prompt that fires on wake (`tool-cards.tsx`).

### Fixed
- **UI prefs/theme now restore after login on a fresh origin**: `fetchServerInfo()` only ran once at mount — before auth — so on a brand-new origin (e.g. a new tunnel URL with empty localStorage) the auth-gated `/settings/theme` and `/settings/ui-prefs` requests got 401 and the 0.13.106 server-side prefs were never pulled. Server info is now re-fetched when auth state flips to authenticated, restoring Wrap Tabs & friends right after login (`app.tsx`).
- **Version switcher visible on deep fork leaves**: `resolveVersionGroup` now walks up the ancestor chain while the queried message lies in the inherited pre-fork prefix, so a grandchild session still shows the `‹ n/m ›` switcher at an ancestor's branch point instead of losing it after two levels of edits (`session-branch.service.ts`).

## [0.13.110] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **Scannable, seamless QR codes in the web terminal**: `ppm status` QR codes were unscannable in the web terminal. The xterm DOM renderer drew block-element glyphs from the brand UI font (Geist Mono), leaving sub-pixel gaps between rows that broke the QR pattern. The terminal now uses a terminal-grade font stack (Consolas/Cascadia/Menlo) whose block glyphs fill the full cell, plus the WebGL renderer which draws block/box-drawing glyphs geometrically (gap-free, like a native terminal) with `onContextLoss` + `try/catch` fallback to the DOM renderer. QR output also uses full-block mode for robustness in plain OS terminals (`use-terminal.ts`, `status.ts`).
- **Failed Edit cards no longer show a stale diff**: Edit/MultiEdit chat cards auto-expand to show the inline diff, but stayed expanded even when the tool result was an error (the diff was never applied). They now skip auto-expand on error and collapse once if the error arrives after expanding (`tool-cards.tsx`).
- **Lost chat sends after same-tab session swap**: `isConnected` is now scoped to the current session, so an edit/fork or version switch can't leak a stale `connected=true` and flush a queued send into a still-CONNECTING socket. Error events also attach to the in-progress assistant message and dedupe identical consecutive errors instead of re-materializing duplicates (`use-chat.ts`).

### Changed
- **xterm upgraded to the 6.1 beta line**: `@xterm/xterm` `6.0.0` → `6.1.0-beta.285` (with matching `addon-fit`/`addon-web-links` betas and `addon-webgl` `0.20.0-beta`), required because WebGL renderer support for xterm 6 currently ships only on the beta line.

## [0.13.109] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **Windows: `ppm restart` timed out and re-zombied the port**: All restart paths (`ppm restart` command file, cloud command, SIGUSR2) killed only the server PID, instantly orphaning SDK grandchildren that hold the inherited listening-socket handle — the respawned server could never bind and restart timed out. Restart now goes through the tree-kill + orphan-reap shutdown path, and `spawnServer` additionally reaps tracked orphans before **every** bind, so crash loops self-heal instead of pausing at max_restarts (`supervisor.ts`).

### Known limitation
- Detached daemons spawned from chat sessions whose parent exits immediately (e.g. `agent-browser`) are undiscoverable by the descendant snapshot (the parent chain breaks before the first 30s sample) and can still pin a port if they outlive the server. `ppm start` falls back to auto-selecting a nearby free port in that case.

## [0.13.108] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Clickable `file:line` refs in chat**: Inline-code references like `utils.ts:6215` (and ranges `utils.ts:6215-6230`) in assistant messages are now clickable — they open the file in the editor scrolled to the line, with the range selected/highlighted. Parsing uses a non-greedy `path:line[-end]` regex anchored to the last `:digits` so Windows absolute paths (`C:\proj\utils.ts:6215`) resolve correctly. A `revealAt` nonce in tab metadata makes an already-open file (or a re-click of the same ref) re-jump, since editor reveal previously only ran on mount and tab dedup ignores the line. This also fixes the search panel's jump-to-line for files that are already open (`markdown-code-block.tsx`, `markdown-renderer.tsx`, `markdown-context.ts`, `code-editor.tsx`).

## [0.13.107] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **Windows: zombie port after upgrade/restart (524 + crash loop)**: The server's listening socket handle is inheritable on Windows, so Claude SDK grandchildren (and any long-running scripts they spawn) keep the port in a zombie `LISTENING` state owned by a dead PID when they outlive the server. `taskkill /T` can't reach descendants whose parent chain already broke, so after an upgrade the new server failed to bind (`exit 1` → supervisor `PAUSED — max_restarts`), the tunnel returned **524** (zombie socket completes the TCP handshake but never accepts), and `ppm stop --kill` couldn't free the port. The supervisor now snapshots the server's descendant PIDs (+ creation time, guarding against PID reuse) every 30s into `~/.ppm/tracked-descendants.json` and reaps survivors on server shutdown, supervisor startup, `ppm stop`, and when `ppm start` finds the port in use — so a stuck port self-heals (`windows-process-tree.ts`, `supervisor.ts`, `stop.ts`, `server/index.ts`).
- **Tunnel URL no longer rotates while the server is down**: The tunnel probe treated a dead origin as a zombie tunnel and regenerated the trycloudflare URL every ~5 minutes during a server crash loop or paused state. It now skips the URL health probe unless the server is actually running (`supervisor.ts`).

## [0.13.106] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- **UI settings survive tunnel/origin changes**: View preferences (Wrap Tabs, Word Wrap, sidebar collapsed/width, git status view mode, active sidebar tab, Jira toggle) are now persisted server-side and restored on load, mirroring how `theme` already worked. Previously these lived only in `localStorage`, which is origin-scoped — switching the tunnel URL gave a fresh empty store, so the settings appeared to reset. New `GET`/`PUT /settings/ui-prefs` endpoints store them as a `ui_prefs` blob in the config table; the frontend pushes changes (debounced) and pulls them back via `fetchServerInfo` (`settings.ts`, `settings-store.ts`).

## [0.13.105] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Cancel an edit**: Editing a message now shows an "Editing message — your next send replaces it" bar above the input with a **✕ Cancel** button. Cancel disarms the pending fork, clears the prefilled input, and the next send goes out as a normal new message. Previously the armed edit state was invisible and could not be abandoned — clearing the input and typing something new would still fork at the old anchor (`chat-tab.tsx`, `message-input.tsx`).
- **Editing highlight**: The user message being edited is highlighted (primary ring + stronger tint) in the transcript so it's clear which message the edit targets — including the first message of a session (`message-list.tsx`, `chat-tab.tsx`).
- **Real-time command output on Windows**: PowerShell (and Bash) tool output now streams live into tool cards on native Windows. Without `pgrep`/`/proc`/`lsof`, the spy discovers the SDK's `.output` file by scanning `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Temp/claude/{project-slug}/*/tasks/` for the newest file born after the tool call started; previously Windows was a no-op and output only appeared when the tool finished (`bash-output-spy.ts`, `ws/chat.ts`).

### Changed
- **Flash-free version switching**: Swapping between edit versions (`‹ n/m ›` or sending an edit) no longer flashes the full-screen "Loading messages…" state — the old transcript stays on screen while the sibling loads, and since versions share an identical prefix only the divergent tail visibly changes (`message-list.tsx`, `chat-tab.tsx`).
- **Input stays mounted across session swaps**: The message input no longer unmounts/remounts (flash + lost text) while the per-session draft reloads on a same-tab session swap; it now waits only for the first draft load, then stays mounted. Typed text survives version switches; a saved draft of the target session still replaces the input content when present (`chat-tab.tsx`).
- **"View Diff" inline with the file path**: On Edit tool cards the View Diff link now sits on the same row as the file name (right beside the open-file button) instead of on its own line; long paths still wrap without pushing the link around (`tool-cards.tsx`).
- **Lazy diff preview**: `EditDiffPreview` extracted from `tool-cards.tsx` into its own lazily-loaded module so the diff renderer loads on demand (`edit-diff-preview.tsx`, `tool-cards.tsx`).

### Fixed
- **WebSockets behind https tunnels**: When the dev UI is served over https (e.g. a Cloudflare tunnel), chat and terminal WebSockets no longer try to connect directly to `ws://host:8081` — which isn't reachable and is blocked as mixed content — and instead use the same-origin `wss://` proxy (`ws-client.ts`, `use-terminal.ts`).

## [0.13.104] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Inline diff preview on Edit/MultiEdit tool cards**: Edit (and MultiEdit, per edit) cards now auto-expand and render a compact inline diff — old lines tinted red, new lines green — directly in the card, so changes are visible without clicking through. Each side caps at 8 lines with a `… +N more lines` indicator; the full Monaco "View Diff" tab is still one click away (`tool-cards.tsx`).
- **Scrollable subagent step list**: The nested step list under Agent/Task cards is now height-capped (`max-h-64` mobile / `max-h-96` desktop) with internal scroll and guarded auto-scroll — it follows the newest step while streaming but pauses if you scroll up to read (`tool-cards.tsx`).

### Changed
- **Diff colors match the Monaco editor**: Inline tool-card diffs now use Monaco-style line tints (new `--color-diff-added` / `--color-diff-removed` tokens, light + dark) with neutral foreground text instead of saturated red/green text (`globals.css`, `tool-cards.tsx`).
- **"View Diff" moved up**: The View Diff link now sits directly under the file name, above the inline diff (`tool-cards.tsx`).
- **Suppressed edit success boilerplate**: Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit cards no longer show the SDK's "The file … has been updated successfully" result line — the inline diff/content already conveys the change. Error results are still shown (`tool-cards.tsx`).

## [0.13.103] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Claude Fable 5 model**: Added `claude-fable-5` (Anthropic flagship) to the model picker and `ppm init`. The model list is now sorted by power (strongest first): Fable 5 → Opus 4.8 → Opus 4.7 → Opus 4.6 → Sonnet 4.6 → Haiku 4.5 (`claude-agent-sdk.ts`, `config.ts`, `init.ts`).
- **Edit a chat message and continue in the same tab (global branch tree)**: A new **Edit** button (pencil) on user messages sits beside the existing Fork button. Editing prefills the message into the input; on send it forks the session at that point (SDK `forkSession` — there is no in-place rewind, so each edit mints a new session) and **swaps the current tab to the forked session** instead of opening a new tab (the Fork button still opens a new tab). Edits are linked into a **global branch tree** persisted in a new `session_branches` table (`child_id`, `parent_id`, `fork_msg_id`, `fork_ordinal`, `root_id`) — schema migrations v29/v30 — enabling a future whole-tree overview. A `‹ n/m ›` **version switcher** appears on any message that has edited siblings; prev/next swaps the tab to the sibling session. The version group is anchored on the divergent message's **user-message ordinal** (stable across forks — `forkSession` reassigns message UUIDs, so a UUID anchor breaks on the child). The session history list **collapses each tree to a single row** (its most recently active node); pinned sessions are never collapsed. Deleting a session is **leaf-only** (409 if it still has edited children). New endpoint `GET /chat/sessions/:id/versions?ordinal=` returns the ordered version group. (`session-branch.service.ts`, `chat.ts`, `db.service.ts`, `chat-tab.tsx`, `message-list.tsx`, `version-switcher.tsx`)

### Changed
- **Default model is now Claude Opus 4.8** (was Sonnet 4.6) for new configs and `ppm init`. Note: Opus has a higher per-token cost than Sonnet; switch per-session in the model picker if you prefer the cheaper default (`config.ts`, `init.ts`).

## [0.13.102] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Operators in tool cards looked struck through**: The ligature fix in 0.13.93 only scoped `.markdown-content` code, but Bash tool-card command/output render in plain `<pre class="font-mono">` outside that scope, so Geist Mono still joined `--`, `===`, `=>` into bar glyphs that read as strikethrough. Replaced the scoped rules with one global rule disabling ligatures on `pre`/`code`/`kbd`/`samp`/`.font-mono`, covering tool cards, Grep/Glob details, and markdown code blocks (`globals.css`).

## [0.13.101] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Windows: tunnel URL now survives upgrade + no blank console windows pop up**: After an in-place upgrade on Windows, two blank terminal windows (`bun.exe` server child + `cloudflared`) appeared and the public tunnel got a brand-new trycloudflare URL every time. Two root causes, both in the self-replace upgrade path. (1) **Tunnel killed on supervisor swap**: cloudflared was launched with `Bun.spawn`, which puts children in the supervisor's Windows job object — so the instant the old supervisor exited at the end of self-replace, the job object closed and killed the tunnel. The new supervisor's `adoptTunnel()` then found a dead PID and spawned a fresh tunnel with a new URL. The tunnel is now launched via `node:child_process` with `detached: true` + `unref()`, escaping the job object so cloudflared outlives the supervisor swap and the new supervisor adopts it by PID — the macOS/Linux orphaning behaviour achieved explicitly. (2) **Pop-up windows**: the new supervisor is itself spawned consoleless (`detached`), so its `Bun.spawn` console children each allocated a fresh visible console window. Added `windowsHide: true` to the server-child spawn, the detached tunnel spawn, and the `taskkill` tree-kill — children (and the Claude SDK grandchildren they spawn) are now windowless regardless of the parent's console state (`supervisor.ts`). Note: the very first upgrade onto this version still rotates the URL once (the still-running old supervisor predates the fix); every upgrade after that preserves it.

## [0.13.100] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **IDE "opened file" context no longer rendered as raw text in chat**: The `<ide_opened_file>` context tag injected by IDE extensions (reporting the file the user has open) was not parsed by the chat renderer, so the full `<ide_opened_file>The user opened the file …</ide_opened_file>` string leaked into the user message bubble as plain inline text. `UserBubble` now extracts the tag, pulls out the file path, and renders it as a clickable "Opened in IDE" chip (reusing `FilePathChip`) above the clean message text (`message-list.tsx`).

## [0.13.99] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- **Chat session now reloads MCP/config when all tabs close**: PPM keeps a persistent streaming query per session, and it reads MCP servers only once at creation — so MCP servers added after a session started never took effect for follow-up messages (no in-app equivalent of terminal `Ctrl+C` + `claude --resume`). When the last listening client disconnects and Claude is idle (turn finished, no pending approval), PPM now tears down the streaming query. The next message recreates it via the resume path, reloading fresh MCP/config while preserving context from JSONL, and frees the idle subprocess. Reuses the existing `set_model` abort-when-idle flow (`server/ws/chat.ts`).
- **Grid panel focus after closing the last tab in a split**: Closing the last tab in a split panel now focuses an adjacent grid panel instead of leaving focus orphaned (`tab-store.ts`).

## [0.13.98] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **Windows: PPM no longer dies after upgrade (zombie-port root fix)**: On Windows the supervisor only killed the direct server-child PID. The server spawns Claude SDK grandchildren that are node-spawned (so they live outside Bun's job object); a single-PID kill orphaned them, and they kept the inherited listening socket open — leaving the port in a zombie `LISTENING` state owned by a dead PID. The previous workaround then shifted the server to a different port (`port+1..+20`), splitting the brain: the tunnel and supervisor still targeted the original port, so the app became unreachable after every restart/upgrade. The supervisor now tree-kills on Windows (`taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F` — the `/T` reaps grandchildren, the Windows analog of POSIX process-group kill) across all three kill paths (health-restart, self-replace/upgrade, shutdown), releasing the socket cleanly. The server child no longer shifts ports: it waits up to 10s for the original port to free and otherwise fails loud so the supervisor respawns on the same port (`supervisor.ts`, `server/index.ts`). macOS/Linux were never affected and their behavior is unchanged (and incidentally hardened to process-group kill).

## [0.13.97] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **Public tunnel no longer disappears after a network blip**: The supervisor's tunnel watchdog had two flaws that left users with no share URL. (1) After 10 quick regenerations it entered a **10-minute cooldown with `shareUrl=null`** — a multi-minute dark window. Removed: the tunnel now retries forever at a capped 60s backoff (+ jitter), so it's never dark longer than ~60s. (2) The health probe killed and **regenerated a brand-new URL after just ~90s** of public-URL unreachability, even though cloudflared self-heals transient QUIC drops on its own — churning URLs and burning the restart budget. The probe now only regenerates a truly-zombied URL (process alive but edge dropped) after ~5min (`TUNNEL_ZOMBIE_THRESHOLD`); real process death still respawns instantly (`supervisor.ts`).
- **Tunnel now always starts with the daemon**: The supervisor still gated the tunnel on the deprecated `--share` flag, so a daemon launched at boot without it (e.g. a stale launchd plist) came up with no tunnel. The supervisor is now unconditional (`share = true`), matching the already-shipping "tunnel always enabled" behavior at `ppm start` (`supervisor.ts`).

## [0.13.96] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Proxy request logging to SQLite**: Every proxy request (success, error, rate_limited) is logged to a new `proxy_requests` table (migration v28) with metadata: endpoint, model, account ID/label, caller IP/UA, status, duration. Message content and tokens are not stored — metadata only.
- **GET /proxy/stats endpoint**: New `GET /proxy/stats` endpoint (behind proxy auth) returns request statistics for the last hour, last 24 hours, and all-time totals, grouped by model, account label, and caller IP. Helps diagnose which caller/model/account is consuming quota.
- **Auto-cleanup of proxy request logs**: 30-day retention on `proxy_requests` table — runs on server startup and daily thereafter, automatically purging older requests.
- **Dismiss & clear chat error messages**: Each error/system bubble (rate limit, usage limit, auth failure) now has an X to dismiss it, and a sticky "Clear all errors" pill appears when more than one is present (`use-chat.ts`, `chat-tab.tsx`, `message-list.tsx`).

### Changed
- **Usage/session limit no longer retries futilely**: Hard usage limits (5-hour/weekly caps that carry a reset time) were lumped into transient `rate_limit` handling, so PPM kept retrying the same exhausted account with backoff and resurfacing the same error repeatedly. They are now classified separately — the exhausted account is cooled down until its real reset time (`onUsageLimit`) and the query rotates through fresh accounts once each, stopping with a single clear error when none remain (`claude-agent-sdk.ts`, `account-selector.service.ts`).

### Fixed
- **Windows graceful shutdown via shutdown file**: On Windows, `SIGTERM` maps to `TerminateProcess`, so the server child's graceful handlers never fired and could leave zombie sockets. The supervisor now writes a `.server-shutdown` file that the server child polls for (200ms), releasing the listening socket cleanly before exit. Auto-selected fallback ports are now persisted to `status.json` so supervisor health checks and the tunnel proxy follow the actual port (`server/index.ts`, `supervisor.ts`).
- **Zombie socket auto-recovery on Windows**: When a `Bun.serve()` process crashes, Windows can keep the listening socket bound to the dead PID. PPM now detects zombie sockets via a `netstat` PID-liveness check and auto-selects a nearby free port (port+1..port+20) instead of failing with "Port in use".
- **Upgrade signal failure now shows error details**: When the supervisor signal fails during `POST /api/upgrade/apply`, the response now includes the specific error reason instead of a generic "Restart manually" message.
## [0.13.95] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **1M context toggle now actually enables 1M**: The 0.13.94 toggle only forwarded the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header, which the current CLI ignores for newer models — `/context` still showed 200k on Opus 4.8. Two changes make it work: (1) the bundled `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` is now synced to the pinned `0.3.146` (its CLI v2.1.146 recognizes `opus-4-8`; node_modules had drifted to `0.2.81`); (2) when the toggle is on, PPM appends a `[1m]` suffix to the model name — the CLI's GA mechanism for a 1M window — which it strips before the API call. Verified end-to-end: `contextWindow=1000000` on an entitled Team account (`claude-agent-sdk.ts`). Requires a Max/Team/Enterprise account and a supported model; others will error.

## [0.13.94] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **1M context window toggle**: New AI-settings switch to enable the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header. Requires an entitled account (Max/Team/Enterprise) and an Opus 4 / Sonnet 4 model; other accounts will error (`config.ts`, `ai-settings-section.tsx`, `claude-agent-sdk.ts`).

### Fixed
- **529 Overloaded errors repeated in chat**: A single 529 (server overloaded) turn rendered the same "API Error: 529 Overloaded…" block multiple times, plus duplicate user bubbles and a stray "No response requested." This came from three sources, now fixed: (1) the provider only detected 401/quota errors in raw assistant text, so 529 text fell through to normal rendering — now `API Error: 5xx` text is detected and routed into the existing retry branch (`claude-agent-sdk.ts`); (2) each retry attempt yielded its own `error` event that accumulated — retries now emit a single replaceable `status_update` ("Đang thử lại (N/M)...") and surface only one final error when retries are exhausted; (3) on reload, the persisted "No response requested." no-op assistant turn now gets filtered (`jsonl-transcript-parser.ts`). Added a frontend safety-net that replaces (not appends) consecutive identical error events (`use-chat.ts`).

### Docs
- **README demo**: Added desktop + mobile demo GIFs (with full-quality MP4 links) to the README.

### Fixed
- **Operators in code blocks looked struck through**: Geist Mono's contextual ligatures joined `===`, `!==`, `=>` etc. into a single connected bar glyph, which read like a strikethrough line cutting through adjacent code. Disabled `font-variant-ligatures` on markdown `pre`/`code` so each operator character renders distinctly (`globals.css`).

## [0.13.92] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Markdown wrongly rendered text as math (KaTeX)**: `remark-math` defaults to `singleDollarTextMath: true`, so any text with paired single `$` — bash variables (`$repo`, `$dir`), prices, regex — was parsed as inline math and rendered by KaTeX, mangling quotes/spacing and turning `===` into operator bars that looked like struck-through text. Disabled `singleDollarTextMath` so only explicit `$$block$$` math triggers KaTeX (`markdown-renderer.tsx`).

### Changed
- **Chat nav buttons always visible**: Up/down message-nav buttons now always render with a disabled state instead of mounting/unmounting conditionally, restyled smaller and translucent with backdrop blur to avoid layout shift as scroll position changes.

## [0.13.91] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **Chat Down nav button got stuck**: The new bottom-right Down button only worked once in a while because its "below" selection threshold (`containerTop + 8px`) was smaller than the `12px` landing offset — after a jump, the just-landed user message still matched the threshold and got re-selected, scrolling ~0px. The threshold now clears the landing zone (`containerTop + SCROLL_OFFSET + EPSILON`), so Down steps through messages one by one and falls back to the bottom after the last (`message-list.tsx`).

## [0.13.90] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Chat scroll buttons → user-message navigation**: Replaced the single centered "Scroll to bottom" pill with a stacked pair of bottom-right icon buttons that navigate between your own messages. Up jumps to the nearest user message above the viewport (hidden when none above); Down jumps to the nearest one below, falling back to the very bottom (hidden when already at bottom). Real user messages are tagged with `data-user-message` (system-context bubbles excluded); button visibility is tracked via an rAF-throttled scroll listener + `ResizeObserver`. Buttons use ≥44px touch targets per mobile-first guidelines (`message-list.tsx`).

## [0.13.89] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- **Markdown text wrongly struck through**: `remark-gfm` defaults to `singleTilde: true`, so any text wrapped in single tildes (`~text~`) — e.g. a stray pair of `~` on one line from shell paths or config — rendered as strikethrough in chat/tool-card markdown. Disabled `singleTilde` so only the explicit `~~double~~` form triggers strikethrough (`markdown-renderer.tsx`).

## [0.13.88] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Per-session model switcher in chat input**: A compact model chip (e.g. "Opus 4.8") next to the provider selector shows the active model and lets users switch it per session. The choice persists per session (new `session_metadata.model` column, DB migration v27) and falls back to the global provider default when unset. Switching while idle aborts the idle subprocess so the next message recreates the query with the new model via the resume path (history preserved); the chip is disabled mid-turn since the SDK can't change model in-flight.

## [0.13.87] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **Claude Opus 4.8 model support**: Add `claude-opus-4-8` as available model across SDK provider, CLI init, proxy test UI, JSON schema, and config validation. Released by Anthropic 2026-05-28 with improved agentic coding (64.3%→69.2%), 1M context window, fast mode 2.5× faster + 3× cheaper, same pricing as Opus 4.7 ($5/$25 per M tokens). Coexists with Opus 4.7/4.6.

### Fixed
- **Rate-limit detection misses quota variants**: Literal `"hit your limit"` match in `claude-agent-sdk.ts` failed against Anthropic's variants like `"hit your weekly limit"` / `"hit your 5-hour limit"`, so quota-exhausted sessions were classified as generic errors instead of `rate_limit` (no auto-switch, no proper hint). Replaced with regex `/hit your (?:[\w-]+\s+)*limit/i` in all three detection sites (HTTP error, assistant text content, error hint message).

### Changed
- **Refresh bundled PPM skill assets**: Regenerated `assets/skills/ppm/{SKILL,references/cli-reference,references/http-api}.md` to current version stamp.

## [0.13.86] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- **Tunnel permanently disabled on transient cloudflared API failure**: Regex `TUNNEL_URL_REGEX` matched `https://api.trycloudflare.com` from cloudflared error output (`failed to request quick Tunnel: Post "https://api.trycloudflare.com/tunnel"`), causing supervisor to treat a failed tunnel as ready with a bogus URL. Combined with `tunnelRestarts > MAX_RESTARTS` permanently disabling the tunnel, a brief network blip left the server with no tunnel until full restart. Fix: negative-lookahead excludes `api.` subdomain (`tunnel.service.ts`, `supervisor.ts`); after MAX_RESTARTS the supervisor now waits 10min, resets the counter, and resumes spawning instead of giving up.

## [0.13.85] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed
- **Skills not loading on Windows**: Slash skill/command discovery walker hardcoded `/` in its symlink-escape boundary check — on Windows `path.resolve()` returns backslash-separated paths, so every subdirectory under `.claude/skills` (and other ecosystem roots) was rejected and zero skills were discovered. Replaced literal `/` with `path.sep` in both boundary checks (`skill-loader.ts`)

## [0.13.84] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed
- **Git Graph auto-reopens in wrong project**: Extension tabs (git-graph) from non-active projects no longer kept alive in TabPool — prevents recovery mechanism from creating phantom tabs showing another project's data on project switch

## [0.13.83] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- **Upgrade Claude Agent SDK**: Upgraded `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` from 0.2.81 to 0.3.146 — includes stability fixes for subprocess crash (JSON parse error on `◆` streaming token)

## [0.13.82] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed
- **Compact command shows raw XML tags in chat UI**: SDK local-command tags (`<local-command-caveat>`, `<command-name>`, `<command-message>`, `<local-command-stdout>`) now properly parsed — compact messages render as clean slash command chip + plain text output instead of raw XML

## [0.13.81] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **Text not selectable in AI question dialog**: Question text, option labels, and descriptions in the AskUserQuestion card can now be selected and copied

## [0.13.80] - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- **Cloud WS notification dispatch**: Replaced local web push with cloud WebSocket notification dispatch

## [0.13.79] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- **Running `bun test` on host kills PPM service**: Module-level `afterEach` in autostart-register test called `disableAutoStart()` after every test (including always-run cross-platform tests), which executed `systemctl --user stop ppm.service` and killed the production PPM

## [0.13.78] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter not working in SQL files**: SQL files opened in code editor now support Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to run the statement at cursor, matching database viewer behavior

## [0.13.77] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **SQL autocomplete suggests columns from wrong table**: When editor contains multiple statements, autocomplete now scopes table references to the current statement at cursor instead of all statements in the editor

## [0.13.76] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **Fork session returns empty session**: Forking a chat at a specific message no longer silently creates an empty session when the SDK can't find the message UUID. Backend now returns `400` with clear error and FE shows a toast — common after auto-compaction or interrupted streams.
- **Ghost message UUIDs in streaming**: Provider no longer captures `lastMessageUuid` from `stream_event` partial envelopes (per-event UUIDs that aren't persisted to JSONL). Only canonical `SDKAssistantMessage.uuid` is used, eliminating ghost UUIDs that broke fork/rewind around auto-compact boundaries.

## [0.13.74] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **SQL BEGIN transaction error in Postgres**: Running `BEGIN;` in SQL editor no longer throws `UNSAFE_TRANSACTION` — transaction control statements are now handled gracefully via `sql.begin()` instead of raw `sql.unsafe()`
- **SQL CodeLens groups transaction blocks**: `BEGIN...COMMIT/ROLLBACK` blocks now show a single "▷ Run Transaction" button that executes the entire block atomically; individual statements inside still get their own "▷ Run" buttons
- **SQL transaction block folding**: `BEGIN...COMMIT/ROLLBACK/END` blocks are now collapsible in the editor so users can see where the transaction starts and ends

## [0.13.72] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **File upload sends path instead of content**: Attaching files via paperclip, paste, or drag-drop now always uploads file content to server instead of resolving to project paths — fixes broken references when host machine differs from PPM server

## [0.13.71] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Readonly toggle on Database Viewer toolbar**: Same ShieldCheck/WRITE toggle added to the database viewer tab toolbar

## [0.13.70] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- **SQL readonly false positive**: `isReadOnlyQuery` no longer blocks SELECT queries containing write keywords inside string literals (e.g. `'NEEDS UPDATE'`)

### Added
- **Readonly toggle on SQL toolbar**: Quick toggle button next to Play button — shows ShieldCheck when readonly, destructive `WRITE` badge when writes enabled

## [0.13.69] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- **Stale extension cleanup**: Extensions removed from codebase (e.g. `@ppm/ext-database`) are now auto-cleaned from DB on startup — previously caused "Entry point not found" error toast on every page load

## [0.13.68] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Git clone in Add Project**: Clone a repo directly from the Add Project dialog — paste a Git URL (HTTPS or SSH), choose a parent directory, and PPM clones and registers the project automatically. Last-used clone directory is persisted.

## [0.13.67] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Extension tabs auto-focus**: Git Graph and other extension tabs no longer steal focus on page load, project switch, or WS reconnect — only explicit user opens (Cmd+G, command palette) trigger focus

### Added
- **Commit-to-commit diff**: Diff viewer now supports comparing a file between two commits via `ref2` parameter, not just commit vs working tree
- **Process age column**: System monitor shows how long each process has been running

## [0.13.66] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **System monitor**: Claude Code sessions (claude-agent-sdk) now appear under "AI Tools" group — fixed two bugs: (1) external processes outside PPM's process tree were not collected, (2) `categorize()` extracted `cli.js` as basename instead of detecting `claude-agent-sdk` path pattern

## [0.13.65] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **DOCX preview**: Fix mammoth.js conversion error — use `Buffer` instead of `arrayBuffer` for Node.js API

## [0.13.64] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **DOCX file preview**: Open `.docx` files in the editor to see rendered HTML preview — powered by mammoth.js backend conversion with responsive styling for mobile

## [0.13.63] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Command palette filter chips**: Result type filtering via chips (files, DB tables, commands) in command palette
- **Persist SQL queries**: Database tab SQL editor content now survives page reloads — stored in tab metadata with automatic localStorage + server sync, fixing shared sessionStorage key bug

## [0.13.62] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **Copy Full Path**: Context menus now include "Copy Full Path" option (absolute path) alongside "Copy Path" (relative) — available in file explorer, tab bar, and mobile nav

## [0.13.61] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Command palette multi-word search**: Typing space-separated words (e.g. "company parent") now matches files like `company.parent.entity.ts` and DB tables like `company_parents` — each word is matched independently instead of requiring exact substring

## [0.13.60] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- **Stale message replay after token refresh**: When OAuth token refresh triggered during a follow-up message, retry paths replayed the first message of the session instead of the current one — now tracks latest user message per streaming session

## [0.13.59] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **PDF auto-reload**: PDF preview tab auto-reloads when file changes on disk via WebSocket file watcher — no more manual refresh while editing LaTeX/docs
- **Seamless blob URL swap**: `useBlobUrl` hook revokes old URL only after new one is ready, avoiding blank flash during refresh

### Fixed
- **PDF scroll preservation**: Switched from blob URL to direct server URL so `location.reload()` preserves browser PDF viewer scroll position. Auth middleware extended to accept `?token=` for `/files/raw` paths

## [0.13.55] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Chat draft auto-save**: Message input content is automatically saved per session and restored when switching tabs or reloading — no more lost drafts
- **Git Log panel**: New tab type accessible from Git Status panel showing commit history with ref badges, authored dates, and commit details
- **Git ref badge component**: Reusable ref badge with deterministic color hashing, sync/remote/tag/stash indicators

### Changed
- **Git Graph ref badges redesign**: Switched from solid-fill badges to border + tinted-bg style with dark-mode support; merged local+remote refs into single "synced" badge with cloud icon
- **Breadcrumb lazy-load fix**: Segment dropdown now loads ancestor directories top-down so deep files opened via search/quick-open resolve correctly

### Fixed
- **Draft cleanup on session delete**: Drafts are cleaned up when deleting individual sessions or bulk-clearing history; orphaned drafts are also pruned

## [0.13.54] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **`--json` flag for all db CLI commands**: `ppm db list`, `tables`, `schema`, `data`, `query` now accept `--json` for structured JSON output — fixes AI agents failing on `ppm db list --json`

### Fixed
- **Misleading docs about `--json` support**: Skill docs claimed all listing commands support `--json`; updated to be accurate and added `--help` guidance

## [0.13.53] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Terminal rendering leaked chat events**: JSON messages with a `type` field (e.g. `session:unread_changed`, `phase_changed`, `thinking`) were written as raw text into xterm instead of being silently dropped — broadened the terminal WS message filter to reject all typed JSON, not just 4 known control types

## [0.13.52] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Gitignored directories missing from palette search**: Typing an exact path like `output/.../file.png` found nothing because gitignored directories were hard-skipped (no recursion). Now gitignored directories are walked and their files surfaced with `isIgnored` flag — large dirs like `node_modules`/`dist`/`build` are still hard-excluded by the glob pattern list

## [0.13.51] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- **Diff view covers other tabs**: Monaco DiffEditor sets `visibility: visible` on internal elements, overriding the wrapper's `visibility: hidden`. Switched inactive tab hiding to `display: none` which cannot be overridden by children
- **Disable production source maps**: Removed source maps from production build to reduce bundle size

## [0.13.50] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Terminal session persistence across reload**: Terminal tabs now reconnect to the same PTY session after page reload, preserving output history
- **Terminal WS bypass Vite proxy**: Dev mode connects terminal WebSocket directly to backend (port 8081), bypassing Vite's unreliable WS proxy
- **Duplicate buffer on reconnect**: Prevent React StrictMode from creating duplicate WebSocket connections that replay buffer twice
- **Fresh terminal on tab reopen**: Closing a terminal tab clears persisted session so reopening creates a new PTY instead of reconnecting to the old one

## [0.13.48] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Send terminal content to chat**: "Chat" button in terminal status bar and mobile toolbar sends selected text (or last command output) to the chat input as a removable attachment chip
- **Terminal attachment preview**: Click terminal attachment chip to expand/collapse inline code preview
- **Text content attachments**: `ChatAttachment` supports inline `textContent` field for text snippets (no server upload needed)

### Changed
- **Terminal buffer size**: Increased max output buffer from 10KB to 200KB for better scrollback
- **Terminal reconnect grace period**: Extended from 30s to 2min to survive page reloads

## [0.13.47] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Unread tint in session list panel**: Session rows on the main session list page now show background tint + bold text for unread sessions (same treatment as sidebar history bar)

### Fixed
- **Bell popover text invisible on light theme**: Session title text was inheriting tint color, now uses `text-foreground` for readability
- **Session titles missing in bell popover**: Added `last_known_title` column to `session_metadata` (migration v23), saved when incrementing unread. `getAllUnread()` uses `COALESCE(session_titles.title, last_known_title)` so SDK-generated titles display correctly
- **Project identification in bell popover**: Added colored dot matching project avatar color in group headers

## [0.13.46] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Chat crash on load**: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'O' before initialization` — `topUnexpandedCompact` was used in `useCallback` dependency array before its `const` declaration (temporal dead zone). Moved declaration above the callback

## [0.13.45] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed
- **Debug: enable source maps** for production build to trace runtime errors with real file names

## [0.13.44] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **PWA icon 404**: Manifest and service worker referenced `.png` icons but only `.svg` files existed, causing download errors. Updated icon refs to match actual SVG assets
- **Tab reload on project switch**: TabPool only rendered active project's tabs, causing all chat/terminal tabs to reload when switching projects. Now renders tabs from all visited projects via `projectGrids` for keep-alive

## [0.13.43] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- **Chat infinite scroll**: Replaced manual "Load XX more messages" button with auto-loading IntersectionObserver sentinel. Scrolling up now seamlessly loads both in-memory paginated messages and pre-compact JSONL history without separate buttons. Includes 150ms debounce to prevent cascade triggers

## [0.13.42] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Tab reload on project switch**: Switching projects caused all chat/terminal tabs to reload and lose state. TabPool only rendered the active project's tabs, unmounting old ones. Now renders tabs from all visited projects via `projectGrids`, preserving component state across project switches

## [0.13.41] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Cross-project tab leak**: Tabs from other projects could appear in the current project's tab bar due to a race condition in `openTab` during fast project switching. Added defensive `projectId` filter in TabPool, TabBar, and MobileNav

## [0.13.40] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Scroll jank in all tabs**: `opacity: 0` on inactive tab wrappers created a separate GPU compositing layer per tab, degrading scroll performance. Switched to `visibility: hidden` which skips painting entirely

## [0.13.39] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Blank panel after split**: Splitting a tab caused the original panel's content to disappear. The `useEffect` cleanup in EditorPanel fired asynchronously after the new EditorPanel had already registered its slot, deregistering it again. Removed the redundant cleanup — callback ref already handles deregistration synchronously

## [0.13.38] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Closed tab ghost stays visible**: Closing a tab left its DOM wrapper orphaned in the panel slot (React's `removeChild` failed because the node was reparented). Added `useLayoutEffect` cleanup to move wrapper back to hidden container before React unmounts it

## [0.13.37] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Eruda mobile console**: Add optional Eruda debug console for mobile debugging — activated via `?eruda` URL query parameter. Loads on-demand, no impact on normal usage

## [0.13.36] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Mobile tab overlap**: Tabs from non-focused panels overlapped in the visible panel's slot because their wrappers stayed reparented from a previous render. Now moves orphaned wrappers back to the hidden container when their panel slot isn't mounted

## [0.13.35] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Infinite re-render loop crashes app (React #185)**: `NotificationBellPopover` used `useProjectStore` selector returning new object without `useShallow` — zustand's `Object.is` comparison always detected "change", triggering infinite re-renders. Added `useShallow` to match all other components

## [0.13.34] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Infinite re-render loop (React #185) from DOM patches**: v0.13.29 preemptive `parentNode` check in `removeChild`/`insertBefore` silently skipped DOM operations, leaving React's state inconsistent → infinite retry loop. Switched to try/catch that only swallows `NotFoundError`, preserving normal DOM behavior

## [0.13.33] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Notification bell in project bar**: Bell button with unread session count badge in sidebar footer. Popover lists unread sessions grouped by project with session titles — click to navigate directly
- **Session titles in notifications**: Backend `getAllUnread()` JOINs session titles, WS broadcasts include `sessionTitle` for display in bell popover

### Fixed
- **Web title unread count inflated**: `selectTotalUnread` was summing event counts instead of counting sessions — reading one session could subtract multiple from the `(N)` title badge. Now counts unique sessions

## [0.13.32] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Windows restart timeout with old supervisor**: `ppm restart` command file approach requires supervisor v0.13.31+. Old supervisors ignore unknown `restart` action. Added fallback: if server PID doesn't change within 5s, kill server process directly — supervisor auto-respawns it

## [0.13.31] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Windows restart fails with SIGUSR2 error**: `ppm restart` on Windows threw `TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_SIGNAL]: Unknown signal: SIGUSR2` — Unix signals don't exist on Windows. Now writes command file that supervisor polls every 1s (same mechanism as upgrade). Also fixed `ppm start` sending SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 directly on Windows for resume/upgrade paths

## [0.13.30] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Session read 404**: `clearForSession` in notification store called `/api/chat/sessions/{id}/read` — missing project prefix. Now uses `/api/project/{name}/chat/sessions/{id}/read`
- **Workspace sync 404 for `__global__`**: Virtual `__global__` project is not a real server project. Skip workspace fetch/sync to avoid 404 noise

## [0.13.29] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **removeChild crash persists despite error boundaries (v0.13.27-28)**: Error boundaries cannot catch this — the error occurs in React's commit-phase DOM operations before React can route it to any boundary. Browser extensions inject DOM nodes that desync React's virtual DOM. Patched `Node.prototype.removeChild` and `insertBefore` to silently skip mismatched nodes (standard React #11538 workaround)

## [0.13.28] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **removeChild crash still occurs (v0.13.27 boundary too deep)**: Error boundary was wrapping `MarkdownContent` only — the `removeChild` error fires higher up during React's commit phase at the `MessageBubble` level. Moved boundary to wrap each `MessageBubble` in the message list, so individual messages degrade to plain text instead of crashing the entire app

## [0.13.27] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Chat UI crashes with "removeChild" error, preventing page load**: `rehype-raw` in MarkdownRenderer creates DOM nodes that desync with React's virtual DOM. Browser extensions modifying the DOM worsen the issue. Added error boundary around markdown rendering — falls back to plain text instead of crashing the entire app
- **Compact history expansion refactored**: Replaced manual "Load more" button with IntersectionObserver sentinel that auto-loads previous messages and expands compact history when scrolled near top

## [0.13.26] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- **Connection dot → reload button**: Green/red status dot replaced with RefreshCw icon + small status dot overlay. Click spins the icon and reloads chat messages (+ reconnects WS if disconnected)

## [0.13.25] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **UI freezes after compaction — requires reload to see continuation**: `compact_status: done` handler called `refetchMessages()` mid-stream, which replaced all messages with REST history (killing the in-progress streaming message), then reset `streamingContentRef`/`streamingEventsRef`. Next `flushMessages` cycle overwrote the last REST message with empty content, making the UI appear frozen while SDK continued in the background. Fix: removed mid-stream refetch — the turn-end `phase→idle` handler already calls refetch safely after streaming stops
- **Compact indicator shows "Thinking..." instead of "Compacting messages..."**: During compaction, `phase` is `"thinking"` so `isStreaming` is true — the streaming ThinkingIndicator rendered with generic "Thinking..." label. The compact-specific indicator (`!isStreaming && compactStatus`) was dead code during actual compaction since it required `!isStreaming`. Fix: pass `"Compacting messages..."` as `statusMessage` to the streaming indicator when `compactStatus === "compacting"`, removed the dead `!isStreaming` branch

## [0.13.23] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **systemd "not our child" prevents auto-restart**: When upgrading from v0.13.20 (old Bun.spawn path), systemd loses track of the new supervisor and silently ignores Restart=always on exit. Supervisor now self-heals on startup — detects stale unit file, regenerates it, and restarts through systemd to get properly tracked

## [0.13.22] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Tab state lost on move/split**: Moving or splitting tabs caused full component remount, losing chat scroll, terminal buffer, editor cursor/undo. Now uses DOM reparenting (TabPool) — components mount once and physically move between panel slots without unmounting

## [0.13.21] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **systemd kills PPM during self-replace upgrade**: selfReplace() spawned a new supervisor via Bun.spawn() that systemd couldn't track ("not our child"), leading to service death on daemon-reload. Now exits cleanly under systemd and lets Restart=always bring it back with updated code
- **Service not auto-restarting**: Changed systemd Restart=on-failure → Restart=always so PPM always recovers regardless of exit reason
- **Autostart tests kill production PPM**: integration tests overwrote the real ppm.service file with test config and triggered daemon-reload, killing the running server. Tests now skip when PPM service is already active

## [0.13.20] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Loading messages flash on mobile**: "Loading messages..." screen flashed after every AI response and on WS reconnect (e.g. phone screen off/on). Now uses stale-while-revalidate — keeps current messages visible during background refetch

## [0.13.19] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Windows upgrade no auto-restart**: `ppm upgrade` on Windows upgraded files but didn't restart the server — SIGUSR1 doesn't exist on Windows. Now writes command file that supervisor polls every 1s
- **Windows path traversal rejection**: File tree lazy-loading and zip downloads failed on Windows hosts — `assertWithinProject` hardcoded `/` separator instead of `path.sep`
- **Upload response backslash paths**: Upload endpoint returned `input\file.jpg` on Windows instead of `input/file.jpg`, breaking frontend path matching

## [0.13.17] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Swipe-to-dismiss stale closure**: Bottom sheet swipe gesture could fail to dismiss due to stale `dragY` state in touch end handler — now uses ref for reliable threshold check
- **No upload progress feedback**: Dragging files into the file tree showed no visual feedback — now shows toast with loading spinner, success/error result
- **Duplicate Loader2 import**: Consolidated duplicate lucide-react import in file-tree.tsx

## [0.13.16] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **File tree explorer overhaul**: VS Code-style file explorer with git decorations, inline rename/create, drag-to-move, cut/copy/paste, collapse all, keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, F2, Delete), multi-selection (Ctrl+Click, Shift+Click), compact folders, reveal active file
- **File copy API**: `POST /files/copy` endpoint for copying files/folders within a project
- **File icon map**: 40+ file type icons with color coding in the explorer tree
- **Adaptive context menu**: Unified component (`adaptive-context-menu.tsx`) — right-click menu on desktop, long-press bottom sheet on mobile. Drop-in replacement for radix ContextMenu
- **Reusable bottom sheet**: Shared `BottomSheet` component with swipe-to-dismiss gesture, used by context menus, project selector, and mobile nav action sheets
- **Mobile detection hook**: Centralized `useIsMobile()` hook for reactive breakpoint checks

### Changed
- **Project bottom sheet**: Migrated to shared `BottomSheet` component with swipe-to-dismiss
- **Mobile nav action sheets**: Migrated to shared `BottomSheet` component with swipe-to-dismiss
- **File tree modularized**: Split into tree-node, context menu, inline input, keyboard nav, file upload drag, and file icon map modules

### Fixed
- **Double context menu on mobile**: Nested radix ContextMenus caused two menus to open on long-press — resolved by adaptive component with stopPropagation
- **File opens during long-press**: Click event suppressed after long-press context menu trigger on mobile
- **Git folder decorations broken**: `isDir` variable used before declaration in tree-node git status selector
- **Missing useState import**: `useState` removed from file-tree.tsx imports but still used — restored
- **Global clipboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+X/C/V was intercepting all keyboard events globally — scoped to file tree container focus

## [0.13.15] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **File compare with absolute paths**: Comparing files outside the project (e.g. `/tmp/`) no longer fails with "Path traversal not allowed" — absolute paths now use `readSystemFile` instead of project-scoped read

## [0.13.14] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **DB CLI run multi-statement**: PostgreSQL `ppm db run` now splits SQL into individual statements and executes within `sql.begin()` transaction. Handles strings, comments, dollar-quoting. Strips user-supplied `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` to avoid conflicts with managed transaction

## [0.13.13] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **DB CLI run command**: `ppm db run <name> <file.sql>` executes SQL files against saved connections. Supports multi-statement files and transactions (`BEGIN...COMMIT`). Respects readonly flag. Works with both SQLite (`db.exec()`) and PostgreSQL

## [0.13.12] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **CLI project add/remove missing config**: `configService.load()` now called before project operations in CLI context to ensure SQLite config is loaded
- **Project sync data loss on SIGKILL**: `syncProjectsToDb` wrapped in transaction — DELETE + INSERT are atomic, preventing wiped project list on forced kill
- **Supervisor stale device name**: `device_name` is now read directly from SQLite instead of in-memory `configService` cache, which was never updated when server process wrote changes

## [0.13.11] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **Chat input lag on text selection**: Shift+arrow, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C keystrokes in textarea no longer run through 21+ global keybinding checks — early return guard skips all but save-prevent (Mod+S) when focus is inside text inputs
- **Chat input re-renders from file store**: MessageInput now uses imperative Zustand subscribe() instead of hook selectors, preventing re-renders on file index updates
- **Inline lambda breaking MessageInput memo**: Stabilized `onExternalPathsConsumed` callback with useCallback in ChatTab
- **Streaming re-renders blocking main thread**: Replaced requestAnimationFrame (~16ms/60fps) with setTimeout(100ms) throttle and wrapped setMessages in startTransition for low-priority rendering

## [0.13.9] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Inline SQL result panel**: Run button in .sql files now executes queries inline, showing results in a bottom panel with DataGrid (supports eye icon preview, export, etc.). "Open in Tab" button opens full DB Viewer for advanced use
- **Resizable preview panels**: Both DataGrid cell/row preview and SQL result panels now have drag-to-resize handles (min 80px)

## [0.13.8] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **DB viewer inline preview panel**: Eye icon opens a Monaco editor preview panel at the bottom of the data grid with syntax highlighting, beautify (JSON/XML), and word wrap toggles. "Open in Tab" button creates uniquely-named tabs (e.g. `Row #42 — users`) for side-by-side comparison

### Fixed
- **DB viewer duplicate "Untitled" tabs**: Cell/row viewer tabs now have unique IDs via `viewerKey` metadata in `deriveTabId`, allowing multiple viewer tabs to coexist
- **Inline content tab title override**: Code editor no longer overrides caller-set titles for inline content tabs to "Untitled"
- **Tab hover tooltip**: Tab bar now shows full title on hover for truncated tab names

## [0.13.7] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Mobile code editor toolbar**: Bottom toolbar on touch devices with paste, undo/redo, tab and 18 symbol keys (brackets, quotes, operators). Matches terminal toolbar pattern. Paste uses Clipboard API on HTTPS, textarea fallback on HTTP. Visual viewport tracking keeps toolbar above mobile keyboard

## [0.13.6] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Mobile tab tag left-edge bar + amber streaming icon**: Tab tag indicator mirrors desktop left-edge bar style on mobile. Streaming icon uses amber color for consistency with favicon streaming indicator

### Fixed
- **Fork fails on compacted sessions ("Message not found")**: After SDK compaction, old message UUIDs are purged from session JSONL. Forking at a pre-compaction message threw 500. Now catches the error and falls back to a fresh session — user's message is still pre-filled in the new tab

## [0.13.5] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Tunnel URL changes shortly after upgrade (WSL/systemd)**: Adopted tunnel was dying ~10-15s after old supervisor exited during self-replace upgrade, forcing a tunnel respawn with a new trycloudflare URL. Root cause: `Bun.spawn(..., { stderr: "pipe" })` tied cloudflared's stderr to a pipe held by the *old* supervisor; when that supervisor exited, the pipe's read-end closed and cloudflared received `SIGPIPE` on its next periodic log write (typical cadence ~10-15s). `systemd-run --scope` wrapping did NOT protect against this because `--scope` inherits stdio from the invoker. Fix: redirect cloudflared stderr to `~/.ppm/cloudflared.log` (file fd, not pipe). URL extraction polls the file instead of reading the pipe stream. Tunnel now survives parent exit cleanly — adopted URL persists across upgrades

## [0.13.4] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Expand compact duplicated post-compact messages + scrollbar jumped**: Claude's compact summary references the CURRENT session JSONL (pre+summary+post in one file), so parsing the whole file and prepending re-inserted the compact marker and every post-compact message. Frontend now sends the compact message's raw uuid as `&before=<uuid>`; `parseJsonlTranscript` stops at that line (exclusive) so only pre-compact messages return. For nested expansions, the `pc-{hash}-` prefix is stripped before sending so the recursive boundary resolves correctly. Also added a manual scroll anchor — `ScrollAnchorBridge` captures `scrollTop`+`scrollHeight` before the prepend and restores `scrollTop + (newHeight - oldHeight)` after the commit (skipped when user is at bottom so `use-stick-to-bottom` retains control). Replaces the CSS `overflow-anchor: auto` fallback which was unreliable on large prepends
- **Command palette: `.git` files leaked into results + `.env` was missing**: Two compounding bugs. (1) Glob regex treated `**/X` as requiring at least one parent segment, so hardcoded `**/.git` exclude silently failed at repo root — users searching for e.g. `refs` got flooded with `.git/refs/heads/...` entries. (2) Gitignore logic hard-excluded all ignored paths, so `.env` never reached the index. Fix:
  - `globPatternToRegex`: detect `**/` prefix, emit `(^|.*/)X(/|$)` so root-level matches work
  - `walkForIndex`: soft-exclude gitignored FILES (surface with `isIgnored: true` flag), hard-exclude gitignored DIRECTORIES (skip recursion to avoid walking huge dirs)
  - Palette: render `isIgnored` entries with `opacity-60` + tooltip so `.env` shows up visibly-muted, distinguishable from tracked files
  - Tests updated — previously asserted the buggy behavior as correct

## [0.13.3] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- **File Compare** — Side-by-side diff viewer for comparing two files or file versions
  - Four ways to trigger: (1) tab context menu "Select for Compare" / "Compare with Selected", (2) file tree context menu (same), (3) command palette "Compare Files...", (4) keyboard shortcut `Mod+Alt+D`
  - Reuses existing `DiffViewer` component + `/files/compare` API endpoint
  - Supports dirty buffer content: unsaved editor changes captured at select-time
  - New zustand store `useCompareStore` persists selection across reload (strips dirty content >500KB)
  - Auto-clears selection on project switch
  - New keybinding action `compare-files` with customizable default `Mod+Alt+D`

### Changed
- **Tab tag indicator moved to left-edge bar (VS Code style)**: Previously, tag colored the chat icon directly — caused false positives where untagged active tabs looked tagged (inherited `text-primary` blue). Now tag renders as a floating `2px × 60%-height` rounded-right bar at `left-0` of the tab wrapper. Zero layout shift (absolute positioned), no conflict with `border-b-2` active indicator. Icon color reverts to normal active/inactive states
- **Streaming icon + typing dots now amber** (matches favicon streaming color `#f59e0b`) so the "in process" signal is consistent across tab icon and browser favicon. Applied via `text-amber-500` on icon wrapper during `isStreaming`; dots inherit via `bg-current`

### Fixed
- **Compact indicator stuck after turn ends**: `compactStatus="compacting"` was only cleared by a matching `compact_boundary` from the SDK. SDK can emit `status: compacting` without a subsequent boundary (turn finishes first, stream tears down, or compaction is deferred), so the indicator stayed on the UI even after the session returned to idle. Fix:
  - Server persists `compactStatus` on `SessionEntry` and force-clears + broadcasts `compact_status: done` on turn `done` and in the consumer `finally` block (covers errors, closes, deferred compaction)
  - `session_state` payload now carries `compactStatus` on connect / reconnect / `ready`, so late-joining clients see authoritative state instead of stale/missing updates
  - Client clears `compactStatus` on `phase_changed → idle` as a belt-and-braces guard and honors `state.compactStatus` in `session_state`
  - Debug logs added under `[chat] session=<id> compact_status=…` for each transition (set / boundary / cleared-on-done / cleared-on-teardown) to make regressions easy to diagnose

## [0.13.2] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Chat tab badges redesign** — reduced visual noise from 3 separate indicators to integrated icon states:
  - **Tag**: removed left-side color dot, now colors the chat icon itself. Untagged tabs force neutral gray (`text-text-secondary`) regardless of active state, so they don't get confused with blue-tagged tabs when active (`text-primary` was leaking into icon)
  - **Streaming**: replaced top-right pulsing green dot with **Messenger-style typing dots** bouncing inside the chat bubble icon (3× `size-[2px]` circles using `bg-current` + staggered `animationDelay`). Added `tabTypingBounce` keyframe (1.5px translate, 1s loop) to `globals.css` with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback
  - **Notification**: unchanged — still top-right colored dot when unread and tab inactive
- **Favicon streaming indicator** — replaced blue/amber flash with **typing dots animation** on amber background (`#f59e0b`, high-attention) for better peripheral visibility. Pre-encodes 4 frames (3 active positions + 1 rest frame — rest frame makes cycle boundary perceptible so all 3 dots appear to bounce equally) cycled every 300ms. `setFavicon()` signature changed: second arg is now `streamingFrame: number | null` (null = idle) instead of `isStreamingAlt: boolean`. Exports `STREAM_FRAME_COUNT` for DRY cycling in `useNotificationBadge`

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **WSL/Linux upgrade killed entire PPM stack (100% repro)**: Under `systemd` with `Type=simple`, the old supervisor's `process.exit(0)` at the end of `selfReplace()` triggered `KillMode=mixed` cgroup cleanup that SIGKILLed the freshly-spawned new supervisor along with server + cloudflared. Root cause: `Bun.spawn + unref()` does not escape the unit cgroup. Fix combines two changes:
  - **Type=notify + MAINPID handoff**: Generated systemd unit now uses `Type=notify` / `NotifyAccess=all`. New supervisor sends `READY=1` via `sd_notify` on startup; during `selfReplace()`, old supervisor sends `MAINPID=<new_pid>` so systemd re-tracks the new supervisor as MainPID *before* the old one exits — cgroup is preserved instead of torn down
  - **Tunnel in transient systemd scope**: `spawnTunnel()` now wraps `cloudflared` in `systemd-run --user --scope --quiet --collect` when running under systemd, hoisting the tunnel into its own cgroup so the trycloudflare URL survives ppm.service restarts (even the worst-case one). Preserves `adoptTunnel()` domain continuity across upgrades
  - **Auto-migration**: `ppm start` detects stale unit files missing `Type=notify` and regenerates them silently; user runs one `systemctl --user restart ppm.service` after first upgrade to pick up the new unit

### Added
- **`src/services/sd-notify.ts`**: Thin wrapper around `systemd-notify` binary for `READY=1` / `MAINPID=` messages. No-op when `NOTIFY_SOCKET` is unset (non-systemd)
- **`isAutoStartUnitStale()` helper**: Detects outdated systemd unit files so `ppm start` can regenerate them inline

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **`ppm export skill`**: Install a Claude Code skill at `~/.claude/skills/ppm/` so external AI agents can control PPM via its CLI, HTTP API, and SQLite config DB. Flags: `--install`, `--scope user|project`, `--output <dir>`, `--format claude-code`. Generates `SKILL.md` + `references/{cli-reference,http-api,db-schema,common-tasks}.md`. CLI/HTTP references are auto-generated at build time by walking the Commander tree and scanning Hono route files. DB schema is generated at install time from the user's `~/.ppm/ppm.db` (opened readonly). Re-install is safe: existing files are renamed to `<name>.bak-<YYYYMMDDHHmm>` before overwrite. Preview mode (no `--install`/`--output`) writes the merged `SKILL.md` to stdout.
- **`buildProgram()` export in `src/index.ts`**: Module now exports the assembled Commander tree without parsing argv, enabling build-time introspection for auto-generated docs. Runtime behavior preserved via `import.meta.main` guard.

### Changed
- **Generator rename**: `scripts/generate-ppm-guide.ts` → `scripts/generate-ppm-skill.ts` (plus `scripts/lib/` modules). Output moved from `assets/skills/ppm-guide/` → `assets/skills/ppm/`. `npm` scripts: `generate:guide` → `generate:skill`; `prepublishOnly` updated.

## [0.12.12] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Login broken when using `--share` without profile**: The `--share` flag was positionally parsed as a DB profile name in both supervisor and server child, causing them to read `ppm.--share.db` (with a random auto-generated token) instead of `ppm.db`. Users saw perpetual "Unauthorized" on login despite entering the correct token

### Added
- **Expand compacted conversation**: When Claude compacts context and references a JSONL transcript (`read the full transcript at: ...`), the chat now shows a "Load previous conversation" button. Clicking fetches pre-compact messages via `GET /chat/pre-compact-messages?jsonlPath=...` and **prepends them into the main message list above the compact card** (natural Messenger-style UX) — scroll up to view history, and nested compact summaries in loaded history show their own button for recursive expansion. Expansions are ephemeral (reset on session switch). Extracted shared JSONL parsing into `src/services/jsonl-transcript-parser.ts`. Path validated strictly under `~/.claude/` (symlink-resolved realpath) with a 50MB size guard
- **Full-content diff endpoint**: `GET /git/file-full-diff?file=&ref=` returns original (ref) and modified (working tree) file contents for Monaco DiffEditor

## [0.12.11] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Upgrade wiped user config back to defaults**: `configService.importFromYaml()` unconditionally overwrote SQLite config keys with `{...DEFAULT_CONFIG, ...yaml}` on every `load()` call. The upgrade path via supervisor `selfReplace()` re-ran the saved `originalArgv` — which contained `-c <yaml>` baked into systemd/launchd `ExecStart` — re-triggering the overwrite and resetting user config to defaults + stale YAML contents

### Removed
- **Legacy YAML config support**: Fully migrated to SQLite; removed `-c/--config <path>` CLI flag (from `start`, `restart`, `open`, `autostart enable`), YAML import/migration code, `configPath` in autostart ExecStart, and `__serve__`/`__supervise__` positional config slot. `js-yaml` dep retained (skill frontmatter only)

## [0.12.10] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Auth retry stuck across turns**: `authRetried` was a per-session boolean, so the second 401 in any subsequent turn skipped token refresh and the stream hung. Replaced with per-turn counter (`authRetryCount`, max 2) that resets on each successful turn, so every turn gets a fresh refresh budget
- **Multi-attempt auth recovery**: Centralized auth-error recovery in `recoverFromAuthError` — attempt 1 refreshes the current account's OAuth token, attempt 2 switches to a different active account, only then surfaces an error. All three 401 detection paths (`api_retry`, assistant text, result) share this logic
- **api_retry 401 stall**: When no recovery path remains, break immediately instead of falling through to SDK's internal 10x retry (which wasted ~5 minutes before surfacing the error)

## [0.12.9] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Synthetic auth error leaking into history**: Filter SDK-persisted error messages (`isApiErrorMessage: true`, `error` field, or `model: "<synthetic>"` with auth/rate-limit text) when loading session history — raw "Failed to authenticate. API Error: 401 …" no longer shows up as an assistant bubble after reload

## [0.12.8] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Bash tool header**: Show `description` in the tool card summary instead of the raw command — command still visible in the expanded details

### Fixed
- **TypeScript errors**: Add `session_migrated` variant to `ChatEvent`, replace out-of-scope `writeLog` in server bootstrap with `console.warn`, guard `split("-")[0]` in semver compare, relax `token` to optional in Jira store `saveConfig`, and fix `@/types/project` imports in file-store helpers (alias resolves to `src/web/*`)

## [0.12.7] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Code block scrollbar overlapping text**: Reserve bottom gutter on markdown `<pre>` blocks so overlay-style horizontal scrollbars no longer cover the last line
- **Code block theme mismatch**: Highlight.js syntax theme now swaps with light/dark mode (github light / github-dark-dimmed) — removed forced-dark `pre` override in light mode

## [0.12.6] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **CLI db commands hang (postgres)**: Close postgres connection pool after CLI operations — cached pool's 5min idle timer was keeping the process alive
- **CLI db commands hang (sqlite)**: Same issue — close sqlite cached connections after CLI operations

## [0.12.5] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **CLI db commands hang**: Close postgres connection pool after CLI operations (`db test`, `db tables`, `db schema`, `db data`, `db query`) — cached pool's 5min idle timer was keeping the process alive

## [0.12.4] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Auth retry content leak**: Reset streaming state (`lastPartialText`, `assistantContent`) on retry — prevents stale error text from suppressing retry response
- **Error text not cleared on retry**: Frontend now clears previous streaming events on `account_retry`, removing "Failed to authenticate" text before showing retry response

## [0.12.3] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Claude Opus 4.7 model support**: Add `claude-opus-4-7` as available model across SDK provider, CLI init, proxy test UI, and config validation (coexists with Opus 4.6)

## [0.12.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Quota exhaustion auto-retry**: Detect "You've hit your limit" SDK message as rate limit — triggers account rotation and retry instead of showing raw error
- **False success on error results**: `onSuccess()` no longer called when SDK result has error subtype, preventing failed accounts from staying active
- **Assistant text quota detection**: Detect quota limit messages in assistant text content (not just error field), covering all SDK delivery paths

## [0.12.1] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Tab bar tag support**: Color dot and right-click "Set Tag" context menu on chat tabs in the tab bar

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Session tagging**: Per-project tags (Todo, In Progress, Review, Done) with color-coded dots on session rows
- **Tag management UI**: Create, edit, delete, reorder tags in project settings; set default tag for new sessions
- **Tag filter chips**: Filter sessions by tag across History panel, ChatWelcome, and EditorPanel landing
- **Context menu on sessions**: Right-click (or long-press mobile) for Pin, Rename, Set Tag, Delete — available in all session lists
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Press 1-9 in History panel to quick-assign tags to active session
- **Bulk tag endpoint**: PATCH /chat/sessions/bulk-tag for multi-session tagging (max 100)
- **Tag CRUD API**: Full REST endpoints under /projects/:path/tags with cross-project authorization
- **Auto-tag new sessions**: Sessions auto-get project's default tag on creation

### Fixed
- **Tag persistence**: setSessionTag now uses UPSERT so tags persist for sessions discovered from JSONL (missing session_metadata rows)
- **Route ordering**: Literal routes (default-tag, bulk-tag, reset) registered before parameterized /:id routes to prevent Hono mismatch
- **Tag count accuracy**: Counts refetched from API after tag changes instead of fragile client-side optimistic updates

## [0.11.18] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Tunnel domain loss on upgrade**: Supervisor startup was wiping tunnelPid/shareUrl from status.json before adoptTunnel() could read them; now preserves tunnel info when previous state is "upgrading"

## [0.11.17] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **DB viewer column jump**: Remove smooth scroll animation for instant column navigation
- **DB connection error display**: Show actual connection errors (e.g. "Connection timed out", "connect ECONNREFUSED") instead of generic "No tables cached"
- **DB route timeout**: Add 15s timeout to database routes to prevent proxy 502 on unreachable hosts
- **API client JSON parsing**: Handle empty/broken proxy responses gracefully instead of cryptic JSON parse errors

### Improved
- **Connection import**: Auto-refresh table cache for newly imported connections

## [0.11.16] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Tool card text selection**: Add `select-text` to expanded tool card content so users can select/copy file paths, bash output, and other tool details in chat

## [0.11.15] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Slash command display in chat**: Parse `<command-message>/<command-name>/<command-args>` XML tags and render as styled chip instead of raw text
- **Extension tab auto-reopen**: Track recently closed extension viewTypes to prevent auto-reopen when extension sends `webview:create` after user intentionally closed the tab

## [0.11.14] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **External file preview (image/PDF/video/audio)**: Files opened from filesystem search (e.g. `/tmp/`) now load correctly — `useBlobUrl` routes absolute paths through `/api/fs/raw` instead of project-scoped endpoint that returned 403

## [0.11.13] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Slash command search flicker**: Move fuzzy search from server-side to client-side — eliminates 200ms flicker caused by debounced API calls replacing instant client filter results

## [0.11.12] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Command palette search ranking**: Replace boolean fuzzy filter with 6-tier scoring — exact filename matches now rank first instead of last

## [0.11.11] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Real-time bash output streaming**: Chat displays live incremental bash output during tool execution via WebSocket, with cross-platform support (Linux/macOS)

### Fixed
- **Supervisor port-race during upgrade**: SIGKILL + process group kill + port-availability polling replaces unreliable 500ms sleep; server startup retries port check 4x before exit

## [0.11.10] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **File type icons**: Explorer tree now shows distinct icons for 50+ file extensions — images, videos, audio, databases, archives, spreadsheets, and language-specific code icons with color coding

## [0.11.9] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Streaming favicon indicator**: Favicon alternates between blue and amber when any chat tab is streaming an AI response; notification badge preserved during animation
- **Streaming tab icon indicator**: Chat tabs show a pulsing emerald dot on the icon while streaming, replacing the static notification badge during active streams

## [0.11.8] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Supervisor shutdown timeout**: Use SIGKILL for child processes instead of SIGTERM — prevents 90s systemd timeout caused by orphaned grandchildren (Claude SDK subprocesses)
- **Supervisor signal handler**: Add 5s force-exit safety net if `process.exit(0)` doesn't terminate
- **Tunnel retry overflow**: URL extraction failure path now respects MAX_RESTARTS and resets counter after stable window (previously retried infinitely)

### Improved
- **Supervisor logging**: All supervisor logs now write to stderr so `journalctl` captures full lifecycle events
- **Tunnel exit logging**: Log exit code and signal when tunnel process dies for easier debugging
- **systemd service hardening**: Add `TimeoutStopSec=10` and `KillMode=mixed` to generated service unit

## [0.11.7] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Video preview**: Open video files (mp4, webm, mov, ogg, avi, mkv) in editor tabs with native playback controls
- **Audio preview**: Open audio files (mp3, wav, flac, aac, m4a, wma) in editor tabs with native audio controls

### Refactored
- Extract ImagePreview, PdfPreview into separate files with shared `useBlobUrl` hook (DRY)

## [0.11.6] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Real-time editor reload**: Editor tabs auto-reload when files change on disk (external edits, AI chat, drag-drop upload) via `fs.watch` + WebSocket; skips reload if unsaved changes exist
- **Real-time file tree refresh**: Explorer sidebar auto-refreshes on file system changes instead of only on window focus

## [0.11.5] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Silent message loss on fast streaming**: Race condition where assistant response was never rendered — `done` event cancelled pending rAF before content flushed to React state; now creates assistant message from accumulated refs when no flushed message exists
- **Upload auto-expand**: File explorer now auto-expands the target folder after drag-and-drop upload so newly uploaded files are immediately visible

## [0.11.4] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **AskUserQuestion re-prompting on reconnect**: Replaying turn_events no longer re-triggers already-answered AskUserQuestion dialogs; server enriches answered approvals with response data, client skips stale setPendingApproval during replay
- **Missing user messages on reconnect**: User messages for in-progress turns were lost during WS reconnect; server now includes the current turn's user message in turn_events payload, client uses targeted truncation instead of dropping completed history

## [0.11.3] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Drag-and-drop file upload**: Drag files from OS file manager into explorer sidebar to upload; drop on folder targets that folder, drop on blank area targets project root
- **Upload limits**: 50MB per file, 20 files per drop, path traversal protection

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **Token refresh on 401**: Force actual OAuth refresh when API returns 401, even if token appears fresh by expiry timestamp — fixes intermittent "Token refreshed" message that didn't actually refresh

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Explorer toolbar**: New File, New Folder, and Refresh buttons always visible at top of file explorer
- **Blank-area context menu**: Right-click anywhere in empty explorer space to create files/folders or refresh

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Jira Debug Sessions**: New debug session service replaces bot_task flow — enqueue, resume, cancel debug sessions for Jira results with SDK integration and WS streaming
- **Jira sidebar panel**: Dedicated Jira tab in sidebar (desktop) and mobile drawer with unread badge, ticket cards, watcher form, filter builder, and debug prompt dialog
- **Jira unread tracking**: `read_at` column on results, unread count API, badge on sidebar tab
- **Jira test JQL endpoint**: `POST /watchers/test-jql` to validate JQL queries against live Jira
- **Jira baseline poll**: First auto-poll sets `last_polled_at` without inserting results, preventing flood of old tickets
- **File browser: New Folder**: Create folders with `git init` directly from FileBrowserPicker via `POST /api/fs/mkdir`
- **File browser: Delete Folder**: Remove folders from FileBrowserPicker via `DELETE /api/fs/rmdir` with confirmation
- **WS broadcast helpers**: `broadcastGlobalEvent()` and `forwardEventToSession()` for background processes to stream events to frontend
- **Jira WS events**: Global `jira:*` events dispatched via `window.dispatchEvent` for real-time UI updates
- **Drag files to chat**: Drag files from explorer directly into chat input

### Fixed
- **Extension first-load failure**: Broken WS proxy caused extensions to fail on initial load
- **Git graph SVG alignment drift**: Fixed mobile detail panel and alignment issues
- **Copy button drift on scroll**: Prevented copy button from drifting on horizontal scroll in code blocks
- **Jira config form sync**: Form state now syncs when existing config loads asynchronously
- **Jira search API migration**: Migrated to `/search/jql` API with correct params, fallback to classic endpoint
- **Jira filter display names**: Show display names instead of account IDs in filter chips
- **Bot task FK errors**: Gracefully handle FK errors during Jira poll instead of crashing entire poll
- **Soft-deleted result resurrection**: `insertResult` now resurrects soft-deleted duplicates instead of silently skipping

### Changed
- **Jira settings → sidebar toggle**: Jira moved from settings category to a toggle switch + dedicated sidebar tab
- **DB migration v19**: Added `read_at`, `triggered_by` columns; index for unread count; cleanup stale running results
- **Watcher poll source tracking**: `pollWatcher()` now accepts `source` param (`auto`/`manual`) for triggered_by tracking

## [0.10.5] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Stale status.json after supervisor restart**: `ppm status` showed dead PIDs when supervisor restarted on a different port. Supervisor startup now does a full write (not patch) to clear stale data from previous runs. `updateStatus()` logs errors instead of silently swallowing them.
- **Auth token for extensions**: Extensions (git-graph) and frontend components now include Bearer auth token in all fetch() calls to PPM API, fixing 401 errors when auth is enabled.
- **WS message queuing**: `WsClient.send()` queues messages during reconnection instead of dropping them.

### Improved
- **Git-graph touch layout**: Uses `pointer: coarse` media query instead of `max-width: 768px` for more accurate touch device detection with compact row sizing.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Restore markdown rendering during streaming**: Reverted plain-text bypass that prevented markdown (tables, headers, code blocks) from rendering while assistant is streaming. Full `MarkdownRenderer` now runs during streaming again.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-04-16

### Performance
- **CSS `field-sizing: content` for native textarea auto-resize**: Use browser-native auto-sizing instead of JavaScript `scrollHeight` reads. Eliminates forced synchronous layout reflow on every keystroke. JS resize kept as fallback for browsers without `field-sizing` support (Safari 18.2+, Chrome 123+).
- **CSS `contain: strict` on message list**: Prevents textarea resize from triggering layout recalculation of the entire message list DOM tree. Browser can skip message layout when only the input area changes.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-04-16

### Performance
- **Uncontrolled textarea for chat input**: Converted chat input from React controlled (`value={state}`) to uncontrolled (`defaultValue` + ref). Eliminates React re-render on every keystroke — browser handles text input natively. Fixes input lag on Chromium-based browsers (Coc Coc) on iPad where React's `textarea.value` re-assignment caused jank. Safari was unaffected because WebKit optimizes same-value assignments.
- **Picker state callback deduplication**: Track slash/file picker open state in refs; only call parent `onSlashStateChange`/`onFileStateChange` when state actually transitions. Previously called on every keystroke even when pickers were already closed.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-04-16

### Performance
- **Plain text during streaming**: Bypass heavy `MarkdownRenderer` (6 plugins: remarkGfm, remarkMath, remarkBreaks, rehypeRaw, rehypeKatex, rehypeHighlight) during active streaming. Renders plain text with `whitespace-pre-wrap` while tokens arrive, then switches to full markdown once streaming ends. Eliminates the dominant per-frame cost on iPad/mobile.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-16

### Performance
- **Pre-parsed keybinding combos**: Cache `ParsedCombo` objects on store load/override instead of calling `parseCombo()` on every keydown. Eliminates 21+ object allocations per keystroke. Extension keybindings also cached.
- **rAF-debounced textarea auto-resize**: Batch height recalculation via `requestAnimationFrame` instead of forcing synchronous layout reflow on every keystroke. Significant improvement on mobile/tablet.
- **Early-exit picker state updates**: Skip regex matching and parent callbacks in `updatePickerState` when text has no `/` or `@` characters. Avoids unnecessary work on most keystrokes.
- **CSS `select-none` on chat chrome**: Non-text elements (tool cards, buttons, icons, badges) marked `select-none`; only actual message text is selectable. Reduces browser selection computation cost on Cmd+A.

## [0.9.98] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Auto-start service crash recovery**: `ppm start` now starts via systemd/launchd when autostart was previously enabled, giving OS-level crash recovery (Restart=on-failure). Changed systemd from `Restart=always` to `Restart=on-failure` so `ppm stop` works cleanly.
- **`ppm stop` vs service manager conflict**: `ppm stop --all` and hard-stop now stop the system service first (systemctl stop / launchctl bootout) before killing processes, preventing the service manager from immediately restarting the supervisor.
- **Auto-enable autostart on first `ppm start`**: Server auto-registers with systemd/launchd after successful startup (with `skipStart` so it doesn't double-spawn).

### Performance
- **Chat input lag during streaming**: Extracted inline `onSend` and `onSlashItemsLoaded` callbacks into stable `useCallback` refs in ChatTab, so `memo(MessageInput)` correctly skips re-renders during streaming token updates.
- **Streaming render throttle**: `syncMessages` now batches rapid WS events via `requestAnimationFrame` instead of triggering a React render on every token. Reduces re-renders from hundreds/sec to ~60fps max.

## [0.9.97] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Git Graph duplicate stash entries**: Same stash appeared twice — once as `refs/stash` from `git log --all` and once as `stash@{0}` from `git stash list`. Excluded `refs/stash` from log query since stashes have dedicated rendering.

## [0.9.96] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Git Graph infinite reload loop on project switch**: Extension dispose→recreate during project switch briefly set panel to undefined, triggering reload-recovery effect which dispatched the command again — infinite loop. Fixed by checking `prevProjectRef` before dispatch.

## [0.9.95] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Extension webview infinite error toasts**: Removed retry loop that dispatched `ext:command:execute` every 2s with no limit, causing infinite error toasts when extension failed to activate. Now dispatches once — user closes and reopens tab to retry. Load timeout reduced from 10s to 5s.

## [0.9.94] - 2026-04-15

### Performance
- **Zustand useShallow**: Added shallow selectors to 17 store consumers to prevent unnecessary re-renders on unrelated state changes
- **React.memo**: Wrapped 11 heavy components (CodeEditor, MessageBubble, ProjectBar, TerminalTab, PanelLayout, Sidebar, StatusBar, TabBar, TreeNode, etc.)
- **Lazy loading**: MarkdownRenderer, mermaid, and CodeMirror loaded on demand via React.lazy/dynamic import
- **Code splitting**: Vite manualChunks splits vendor-monaco, vendor-mermaid, vendor-xterm, vendor-markdown, vendor-ui into separate cached chunks
- **Chat pagination**: Display last 50 messages with load-more button for long conversations
- **Team message cap**: Capped team activity accumulation at 500 messages to prevent unbounded memory growth

## [0.9.93] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Infinite tab creation on project switch**: Switching projects with Git Graph open no longer creates 99+ duplicate tabs. Fixed dedup logic in `webview:create` handler to detect existing tabs with `@panelId` suffix variants, and prevented double-dispatch from reload + project-sync effects.

## [0.9.92] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Webview panel lifecycle**: Closing a git-graph tab now properly disposes the panel on the extension side. Previously, the extension kept a stale `activePanel` reference and refused to create a new panel on reopen.
- **Git Graph broken after stash visualization**: Stash virtual commits were inserted after parent in array but graph algorithm scans forward — graph silently broke when stashes existed. Fixed insertion order (stash before parent, same pattern as uncommitted).

## [0.9.90] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Git Graph stash branch visualization**: Stashes now render as separate branch spurs from their parent commit in the graph (like VSCode Git Graph). Grey branch lines, `stash@{N}` badge, and right-click context menu (Apply/Pop/Drop).

### Fixed
- **Wrong project loading in Git Graph**: Fixed bug where switching projects would show the previous project's commits. ExtensionWebview now always dispatches the command on mount to ensure correct project data.

## [0.9.88] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Git Graph spacing too large**: Reduced font sizes, row heights, padding, and column widths across toolbar, commit rows, detail panel, and all UI elements for a tighter, more compact layout.

## [0.9.87] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Git Graph stash management**: Toolbar popover with stash count badge, list all stashes with Apply/Pop/Drop actions, "Stash Changes" button.
- **Git Graph rebase context menu**: "Rebase current branch onto this..." in commit context menu with confirmation dialog.
- **Conflict detection & merge state display**: Parse UU/AA/DD status codes, detect merge/rebase/cherry-pick state from .git sentinel files, show conflict section + banner with Continue/Skip/Abort.
- **Inline conflict resolution editor**: Monaco-based editor with colored decorations (green current, blue incoming) and Accept Current/Incoming/Both buttons.
- **Extension error reporting**: Error toasts for extension command failures, activation error tracking and display on browser connect.
- **Extension breadcrumb logging**: `[ExtService]`, `[ExtHost]`, `[ExtWS]`, `[ext-git-graph]` tagged console.log at each pipeline step.

### Fixed
- **Extension silent failure**: Extensions that failed to activate or execute commands now show error toasts instead of spinning forever.
- **Extension timeout UX**: Improved from generic "failed to load" to specific error message with retry button.

## [0.9.86] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Git Graph worktree management**: Toolbar popover with full CRUD — list worktrees with branch/hash/status badges, create (existing or new branch), remove, and prune stale entries. "Create Worktree Here..." in commit context menu.
- **Project auto-add for worktrees**: Opening a worktree not registered as a project prompts to add it automatically, then switches to it.
- **Extension project switching API**: `window.switchProject()` in vscode-compat allows extensions to trigger project switches via `project:switch` WS message.

### Fixed
- **Branch-already-exists dialog**: Creating a branch that exists now shows replace/cancel dialog instead of a generic error toast.

## [0.9.85] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **New file editor tabs**: Create untitled editor tabs (Untitled-1, Untitled-2...) via Ctrl+N or Command Palette. Content persists in localStorage across sessions. Save As dialog on first Ctrl+S using file browser picker.
- **Right-click context menu on tabs**: Copy path, download, rename, delete files directly from tab context menu.

### Changed
- **Markdown rendering migrated to react-markdown**: Replaced `marked` with `react-markdown` for better extensibility and React integration.

### Fixed
- **Upgrade dismiss persisted to sessionStorage**: Dismissed upgrade banner no longer reappears during same session.
- **WebSocket project path decoded for Windows**: Paths with special characters now work on Windows.

## [0.9.84] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- **Device rename now syncs to cloud**: Implemented JWT token auto-refresh so cloud API calls succeed after token expiry. Previously `refreshAccessToken` was a stub returning null.
- **Cloud sync errors surfaced**: PUT /settings/device-name now returns `cloud_synced` and `cloud_error` fields instead of silently swallowing failures.
- **Heartbeat propagates device name**: Cloud server now persists device name from both WS and HTTP heartbeats, providing eventual consistency even if JWT-based rename fails.

## [0.9.83] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Sessions with large first messages now appear in history**: SDK's `listSessions` silently drops sessions whose first message exceeds its 64KB head buffer (e.g. pasted API docs). PPM now scans the JSONL directory as fallback to recover these sessions.
- **Cloud CLI config not loaded**: `ppm cloud` commands now call `configService.load()` before reading `cloud_url`, so saved config is properly picked up.
- **Supervisor device name sync**: Cloud heartbeat now syncs device name from PPM config to cloud device file when user changes it in settings.
- **Port-forwarding tunnel resilience**: Refactored tunnel spawning with probe failure tracking and auto-respawn for dead tunnels.
- **URL sync UUID validation**: Chat tab URLs now validate session ID format, preventing short/random tab-derived IDs from being treated as session IDs.
- **Test suite fully passing**: Added missing SDK mock exports (`getSessionInfo`, `forkSession`, `renameSession`) and updated `maxTurns` assertions to match current default (1000).

## [0.9.82] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Math formula rendering in markdown**: LaTeX math expressions now render in chat and markdown preview using KaTeX. Supports inline `$...$` and block `$$...$$` notation. Malformed LaTeX degrades gracefully to raw text.

## [0.9.81] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Persistent toast notification for pending approvals**: When an approval request or AI question arrives on a non-active session tab, a Sonner toast with "Go to session" action appears and persists until dismissed or resolved.

### Fixed
- **Approval timeout removed**: `waitForApproval` no longer auto-rejects after 5 minutes. Approvals wait indefinitely until user responds or session is cleaned up.
- **`deleteSession` approval cleanup bug**: Was using wrong key (`sessionId` on a `requestId`-keyed map) — now properly iterates and resolves all pending approvals for the deleted session.
- **Reconnect tool_result reliability**: Tool results are now embedded onto matching tool_use events in the buffer, so reconnecting clients don't lose tool output.
- **Cloud WS reconnect backoff**: Reconnect attempt counter only resets after auth succeeds, preventing tight reconnect loops when server closes immediately after connect.
- **Tunnel URL lazy sync**: `getTunnelUrl()` now falls back to reading `status.json` when supervisor sets the URL after server startup.

## [0.9.80] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **"Session ID already in use" error**: Removed dual-ID system (ppmId/sdkId mapping via `session_map` table). PPM UUID is now used directly as SDK session ID, eliminating the `effectiveIsFirst` heuristic that caused resume vs new-session misclassification.
- **Non-deterministic message timing**: Replaced `setTimeout(500ms)` with `isConnected`-based pending message flush using `useRef` + `useEffect` for reliable first-message delivery after WS connect.
- **Legacy JSON migration crash**: `config.service.ts` called removed `setSessionMapping` — replaced with `setSessionMetadata`.
- **CLI provider session migration**: Restored `session_migrated` WS handler for CLI providers that discover session IDs from CLI output.
- **Fork session not tracked**: Fork route now calls `resumeSession` to register forked session with provider in-memory state.

### Changed
- DB migration v16: creates `session_metadata` table, migrates data from `session_map`, cleans up orphaned ppm_id entries in `session_titles`/`session_pins`.
- Removed `session_migrated` from `ChatEvent` type (SDK provider no longer needs it).
- Removed `migratedSessionId` state from frontend `use-chat` hook.
- Net deletion of ~86 lines of complexity.

## [0.9.79] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Silent hang on resume of never-completed sessions**: When a session's first attempt hung (no SDK `init` event received), subsequent messages tried to `resume` a non-existent JSONL file, causing the SDK subprocess to silently hang. Now detects missing SDK mapping and treats as a new session.

## [0.9.78] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **SDK subprocess stderr logging**: Real-time stderr output from Claude CLI subprocess is now logged to server console for debugging hangs and crashes.
- **MCP servers diagnostic log**: Log which MCP servers are being passed to SDK query.
- **Query creation log**: Log when `query()` async iterator is created to confirm subprocess started.

## [0.9.77] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Streaming hang with no timeout**: `status_update` events (account routing) were treated as real SDK content, prematurely cancelling the 120s heartbeat timeout. If the SDK subprocess hung after account selection, the UI showed "streaming" forever with no error. Now `status_update` is correctly classified as metadata so the timeout still fires.

## [0.9.76] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Concurrent token refresh race**: Multiple sessions starting near-simultaneously all refreshed the same token. Removed redundant in-memory freshness check — `ensureFreshToken()` now re-reads from DB, so concurrent sessions see the already-refreshed token.

## [0.9.75] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Run buttons in SQL editor**: CodeLens providers were registered globally but never disposed on tab close, causing "▷ Run" buttons to multiply with each .sql tab opened.

## [0.9.74] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- **Status update display**: `status_update` events now show as thinking-style indicator (spinner + status text) instead of blockquotes in message body. Transient — not persisted in message history.

## [0.9.73] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Pre-flight token refresh loop**: Account selection now retries all available accounts when OAuth token refresh fails, instead of failing immediately.
- **`status_update` ChatEvent**: Frontend shows real-time status during account routing, token refresh, and account switching phases.
- **`onPreflightFail()` method**: Failed accounts enter 60s–5min exponential cooldown during pre-flight.
- **`excludeIds` param for `next()`**: Account selector can skip specific accounts (used by pre-flight loop).
- Unit tests for `next(excludeIds)`, `onPreflightFail()`, and `all_excluded` fail reason (+7 tests).

## [0.9.72] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Column search/jump**: Columns button + `/` shortcut opens filterable dropdown with arrow key navigation. Scrolls to column accounting for sticky pinned columns.
- **Row viewer**: Eye icon per row opens full row data as formatted JSON in a new editor tab.
- **Shortcut hints**: Footer shows keyboard shortcuts (`/` columns, `⌘A` select all, `⌘C` copy) on desktop.

### Changed
- **Cell viewer**: Opens in a new editor tab (with syntax highlight + beautify) instead of a popup dialog.
- **Column filters**: Now controlled from parent and synced bidirectionally with SQL editor. Editing ILIKE in SQL and pressing Ctrl+Enter reflects filters in table header.

### Fixed
- **Loading overlay**: Spinner now shows on table during query execution (both filter and manual queries).
- **Filter query mode**: Column filter queries and matching Ctrl+Enter queries stay in table grid mode instead of switching to read-only query result panel.
- **Hooks order**: Moved hooks above early return to fix React Rules of Hooks violation.
- **Column search perf**: All search state (query, index) lives inside the dropdown — no DataGrid re-renders on keystrokes.

## [0.9.71] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **CLI db commands**: `ppm db` subcommands (list, add, remove, test, tables, schema, data, query) were implemented but not registered in CLI entry point — now accessible.

### Added
- Unit tests for CLI db command registration and option structure.
- Unit tests for `isReadOnlyQuery` utility (18 cases including CTE attack patterns).
- Unit tests for database routes: readonly enforcement, validation, edge cases (+30 tests).
- Unit tests for db.service connection CRUD: insert, resolve, update, delete, encryption round-trip (+17 tests).

## [0.9.70] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **SDK subprocess crash on resume**: Resumed sessions with existing JSONL files would crash (exit code 1) because `--session-id` was used instead of `--resume`. Now always uses `--resume` for resumed sessions.
- **Session lookup**: Use targeted `getSessionInfo()` with correct project dir instead of listing all sessions.
- **SDK stderr capture**: Subprocess stderr is now logged on crash for diagnostics.
- **Thinking budget option**: Fixed `thinkingBudgetTokens` → `maxThinkingTokens` (correct SDK option name).

## [0.9.69] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Cloud WS replaced loop**: `isConnected()` now returns true during 500ms auth handshake, preventing Cloud monitor from killing valid connections. Fixed `disconnect()` not resetting `reconnecting` flag.
- **Token refresh buffer**: Increased OAuth token refresh buffer from 60s to 1 hour to prevent 401 errors mid-conversation.
- **SDK retry stale closures**: Extracted `closeCurrentStream()` helper that reads from session map instead of captured variables, preventing retry paths from closing already-replaced streams. Fixed phantom session entries from retry init events.

## [0.9.68] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **ConnectionList hooks crash**: Moved `useMemo` out of `.map()` loop to fix React hook order violation (error #310).
- **CodeEditor hooks crash**: Moved `useState`/`useCallback` before early returns to fix React hook count mismatch (error #310).

## [0.9.67] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **Cell viewer**: Large/structured cell data now opens in a new editor tab (with syntax highlighting + beautify) instead of a popup dialog.

## [0.9.66] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **Database viewer overhaul**: Full-featured DataGrid with inline editing, row selection (Cmd+A select all, Cmd+C copy as TSV), bulk delete, insert row, and export (CSV/JSON) for both table view and custom query results.
- **SQL autocomplete**: Context-aware completion for keywords, table names, column names (with alias/dot support), operators, and aggregate functions. Async column fetching with client-side cache.
- **Cell viewer dialog**: Large/structured data (JSON, XML) opens in a Monaco editor with syntax highlighting and beautify toggle. Responsive: large dialog on desktop, 75% bottom sheet on mobile.
- **Column filter (ILIKE)**: Per-column filter inputs with debounced auto-execution via WHERE ILIKE clauses.
- **Pin columns/rows**: Sticky horizontal pinning for columns, sticky vertical pinning for rows. DOM-measured offsets for accurate positioning.
- **Export button**: Export current page or full table as CSV/JSON, with selected-rows-only export.
- **SQL query editor**: Monaco-based with run button, Cmd+Enter execution, and `getStatementAtCursor` for multi-statement files.
- **.sql file run button**: Execute SQL files directly from the code editor against a connected database.

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL SSL errors**: Parse `sslmode` from connection string; `no-verify`/`require` sets `rejectUnauthorized: false`.
- **PK detection**: Boolean coercion from postgres library (`"t"`/`"f"` strings) now handled correctly.
- **[object Object] in cells**: Objects/arrays now JSON-stringified instead of using `String()`.
- **Selection performance**: Replaced @tanstack/react-table with plain HTML + `memo(DataRow)` for lag-free row selection.
- **Mobile touch support**: Pin/filter/delete buttons visible without hover (`md:opacity-0 md:group-hover:opacity-100` pattern).
- **Sticky positioning gaps**: `border-collapse: separate` + ResizeObserver for accurate header/column/row measurements.
- **Autocomplete z-index**: `fixedOverflowWidgets: true` for Monaco suggest widget.

## [0.9.65] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **Removed `ppm cloud link`/`unlink` CLI commands**: Login auto-links, logout auto-unlinks — separate commands no longer needed. API routes remain for web UI.

## [0.9.63] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Cloud auto-link**: `ppm cloud login` now auto-links device (no separate `ppm cloud link` needed). `ppm cloud logout` auto-unlinks.
- **Supervisor cloud monitor**: Supervisor periodically checks cloud-device.json and auto-connects/disconnects/reconnects WS as needed. Fixes "stuck offline" after upgrade or file loss.
- **Stale tests**: Aligned usage-cache and chat-routes tests with current API response shapes.

## [0.9.62] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **SDK subprocess crash auto-retry**: When the Claude Code subprocess crashes (exit code 1), PPM now automatically retries once with a fresh subprocess after a 1s delay, instead of immediately showing the error. Only surfaces the crash message if the retry also fails.

## [0.9.61] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Telegram message clarity**: Thinking blocks now wrapped in `<blockquote>` (indented with vertical bar), tool calls in `<pre>` blocks (monospace background). Much easier to distinguish from actual response text.

## [0.9.60] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Usage chart clarity**: Added data summary, descriptive labels for each section, hover tooltips with sample counts, hour-axis on heatmap, and color legend (low-high + no data).

## [0.9.59] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Usage pattern charts**: Account profile view (eye icon) now shows day-of-week bars, hour-of-day heatmap, and 7x24 grid to identify peak usage times. Toggle between 5-hour and weekly metrics.

## [0.9.58] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **OAuth refresh token races**: Per-account mutex prevents concurrent refresh calls from racing (Anthropic rotates refresh tokens). Skips refresh if token already fresh.

### Added
- **History panel pagination**: "Load more" button loads older sessions. Pinned sessions are always visible regardless of page. Backend supports `limit`/`offset` query params.

## [0.9.57] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Telegram bot thinking display**: Consecutive thinking chunks are now merged into a single `💭` block instead of rendering as multiple broken lines.

## [0.9.56] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Usage panel shows all accounts**: Expired temporary accounts are no longer hidden from Usage & Accounts panel. Users can delete them manually.

## [0.9.55] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Database row deletion**: Delete rows from SQLite and PostgreSQL tables via data grid UI. Hover row to reveal trash icon, click to confirm/cancel inline. Works for both project-scoped SQLite viewer and unified database connections viewer.
- **Delete row API**: `DELETE /sqlite/row` (project-scoped) and `DELETE /api/db/connections/:id/row` (unified) endpoints with readonly enforcement.

## [0.9.53] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Supervisor Always Alive**: `ppm stop` now does a soft stop — kills server only, supervisor stays alive with Cloud WS + tunnel. Use `ppm stop --kill` or `ppm down` for full shutdown.
- **`ppm down` command**: Alias for `ppm stop --kill` (full shutdown).
- **`ppm stop --kill` flag**: Full shutdown that kills supervisor + server + tunnel.
- **Stopped page**: When server is stopped, tunnel URL serves a minimal HTML status page + 503 on `/api/health`.
- **Supervisor detection**: `ppm start` detects existing supervisor and resumes/upgrades instead of spawning a new one.
- **Cloud WS commands**: `start` (resume from stopped), `shutdown` (full kill), `stop` (now soft stop).
- **Exception handlers**: Supervisor catches `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` — never crashes.
- **Lockfile**: Prevents concurrent `ppm start` races (`~/.ppm/.start-lock`).
- **Windows command file polling**: Supervisor polls command file every 1s on Windows (no SIGUSR2).

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `ppm stop` default behavior changed from full shutdown to soft stop.
- **Autostart**: Generates `__supervise__` instead of `__serve__`. Existing users must run `ppm autostart disable && ppm autostart enable` to regenerate.
- **Supervisor modularized**: Split into `supervisor.ts` (orchestrator), `supervisor-state.ts` (state machine + IPC), `supervisor-stopped-page.ts` (stopped HTML server).

## [0.9.52] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Full `ppm bot` CLI**: All 13 Telegram commands now have CLI equivalents — `project switch/list/current`, `session new/list/resume/stop`, `memory save/list/forget`, `status`, `version`, `restart`, `help`. AI can invoke any command via Bash tool from natural language (e.g. "chuyển sang project ppm" → `ppm bot project switch ppm`).
- **Auto-detect chat ID**: `resolveChatId()` auto-detects single approved paired Telegram chat. Falls back to `--chat <id>` when multiple chats exist.
- **System prompt with natural language mapping**: AI receives full CLI reference + Vietnamese/English intent examples, executes commands directly instead of describing actions.

## [0.9.51] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- **`ppm bot memory` CLI command**: AI can now save cross-project memories via Bash tool — `ppm bot memory save/list/forget`. Stores to `_global` scope in SQLite, persists across all projects and sessions. GoClaw-inspired pattern (CLI tool, not MCP).
- **System prompt instructs AI**: AI automatically knows to use `ppm bot memory save` when user asks to remember preferences, change address style, or save facts.

### Changed
- **/memory, /remember, /forget**: Now always use `_global` project scope (cross-project).
- **ppmbot-memory tests updated**: Removed stale tests referencing deleted methods (`recall`, `save`, `parseExtractionResponse`, `extractiveMemoryFallback`).

## [0.9.50] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **/sessions redesigned**: Filters by current project, shows pinned sessions first with 📌 icon, displays session titles (not project names), supports pagination via `/sessions 2`. Matches PPM web UI behavior.

## [0.9.49] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **/resume accepts session ID prefix**: `/resume fdc4ddaa` now works alongside `/resume 2` (index). Matches session by ID prefix from `/sessions` list.
- **/restart actually restarts**: Server now exits with code 42 (restart signal) instead of 0 (clean exit). Supervisor recognizes code 42 and respawns immediately without backoff.
- **Restart notification delivered**: Supervisor respawns after `/restart`, new server sends "PPM v0.9.49 restarted successfully." to all paired chats.
- **/project lists all projects**: `getProjectNames()` now merges config projects + unique project names from session history. Previously returned empty when no projects in config.

## [0.9.48] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Memory → Identity layer**: Stripped custom memory extraction, decay, periodic AI extraction prompts. PPMBot now stores only identity/preferences + explicit `/remember` facts. Contextual memory delegated to provider's native system (Claude Code MEMORY.md). `ppmbot-memory.ts` 333→111 LOC.
- **Removed "don't write memory" directive**: AI provider manages its own contextual memory naturally.

## [0.9.47] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **AI writes to Claude memory files**: Added core directive preventing AI from managing its own memory/identity files. Memory is handled by PPMBot externally.
- **Garbage identity saved**: Removed `hasCheckedIdentity` fallback that saved random messages as identity. Identity only collected through `/start` onboarding flow.
- **Identity onboarding context**: AI now gets a hint that the message is an identity intro, so it acknowledges warmly instead of treating it as a task.

## [0.9.46] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **/version command**: Shows current PPM version in Telegram.

## [0.9.45] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Identity lost on server restart**: Identity save ran AFTER `streamToTelegram()` — if streaming timed out, the save was skipped. Moved identity persistence to before streaming so it writes to SQLite immediately.

### Added
- **Restart notification includes version**: `/restart` now sends "PPM v0.9.45 restarted successfully" instead of generic message.

## [0.9.42] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Port Forwarding UI**: Replaced iframe-based browser preview with a Port Manager. Tunnels now open in a new browser tab instead of an iframe, fixing cross-origin rendering issues with Cloudflare tunnels. Tab renamed from "Browser" to "Ports".
- **Renamed browser → ports**: All code references (files, components, routes, TabType, tests) renamed from "browser" to "ports" for consistency.

### Fixed
- **Git worktree list**: Removed unsupported `-v` flag from `git worktree list --porcelain` command
- **Light mode colors**: Fixed invisible UI elements by using `primary` tokens instead of `accent` (which is subtle gray in light mode)

## [0.9.43] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Identity onboarding asks every /start**: FTS5 search with implicit AND missed keywords. Now checks memory category/content directly.
- **/sessions shows useless list**: Now displays session title (first message preview), session ID snippet, and formatted date/time.

### Changed
- **/project without args**: Lists all projects with ✓ marker on current, instead of just showing current project name.

### Added
- **/restart command**: Exits PPM process (for process manager to restart), notifies all paired chats on successful restart.
- **Memory & Identity section** in PPMBot settings: View and delete stored memories. API: GET/DELETE `/api/settings/clawbot/memories`.

## [0.9.40] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Merged Telegram settings into PPMBot**: Bot token now configured in PPMBot settings (single place). Removed separate Telegram section from Notifications.
- **Notifications go to all paired devices**: Removed `chat_id` config — Telegram notifications now broadcast to all approved paired chats. No more manual chat ID entry.

### Added
- **Test Notification button** in PPMBot settings — sends test message to all approved paired devices.

## [0.9.39] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Stream hangs 3 minutes after AI finishes**: `done` event was received but the `for-await` loop didn't break — `break` inside `switch` only exits the switch, not the loop. Used labeled `break eventLoop` to properly terminate on `done`.
- **Identity never saved to memory**: Memory extraction only ran on session end. Now saves identity directly when user responds to onboarding prompt, and runs AI extraction every 5 messages.

## [0.9.36] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Stream timeout during tool execution**: Per-event timeout increased from 60s to 180s. Tool calls (bash, file writes, memory saves) frequently exceed 60s between events, causing premature stream termination.

## [0.9.35] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Stream hangs forever on stuck AI**: Replaced elapsed-time timeout with per-event `Promise.race` (60s per event). If `.next()` hangs, stream is terminated cleanly instead of blocking forever.
- **"Project not found" when no default configured**: Added `~/.ppm/bot/` fallback project so bot works immediately without project setup.

### Added
- **Identity onboarding**: `/start` now prompts new users for name, role, stack, and language preference when no identity memories exist.

## [0.9.34] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Renamed ClawBot → PPMBot**: All user-facing text, files, classes renamed. DB tables/config key remain `clawbot` for backward compat.

### Fixed
- **Bot unresponsive after first message**: Polling loop blocked on AI stream hangs — now uses fire-and-forget handler calls. All messages + commands stay responsive.
- **Thinking shown but no answer**: Thinking events mixed raw HTML into markdown text, causing double-processing. Now tracks HTML and markdown segments separately.
- **No stream timeout**: Added 5-minute timeout to prevent indefinite AI stream hangs.

### Added
- **Telegram command menu**: Bot registers commands via `setMyCommands` on startup — users see autocomplete when typing `/`
- **Bot personality**: Default system prompt makes PPMBot concise and mobile-friendly. Welcoming `/start` greeting.

## [0.9.33] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **CLI `config set telegram` fails**: `telegram` key missing from DEFAULT_CONFIG, so CLI rejects it as "not found". Added default empty telegram config.

## [0.9.32] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **ClawBot Telegram integration**: Chat with AI providers directly from Telegram
  - Long-polling Telegram bot (no webhook/public URL needed)
  - Progressive message editing with 1s throttle for streaming responses
  - Pairing-based access control (6-char code, approve via web UI)
  - FTS5 memory system with AI extraction + regex fallback
  - Cross-project memory recall when mentioning project names
  - Message debouncing (configurable, default 2s) for rapid messages
  - Context window monitoring with auto-session rotation at >80%
  - 11 bot commands: /start, /project, /new, /sessions, /resume, /status, /stop, /memory, /forget, /remember, /help
  - Settings UI: enable/disable, paired devices, system prompt, display toggles
  - `[Claw]` prefix + bot icon in chat history for Telegram sessions
  - DB migration v13: clawbot_sessions, clawbot_memories (FTS5), clawbot_paired_chats

## [0.9.31] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Tunnel URL lost on self-replace upgrade**: Server child's `stopTunnel()` killed the cloudflared process and wrote `tunnelPid: null` to status.json during SIGTERM — new supervisor couldn't adopt the tunnel. Now sets `.restarting` flag before killing server child so tunnel survives upgrade.
- **Tunnel PID not set before status persist**: `setExternalUrl` called `persistToStatusFile` before `setExternalPid` was called, writing `tunnelPid: null` to status.json on server boot. Reordered to set PID first.

## [0.9.26] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Local endpoint showing tunnel URL**: Proxy settings now returns `localEndpoint` from server's actual port instead of relying on `window.location.origin` which shows the tunnel URL when accessed remotely

### Changed
- **Proxy test UI → dialog**: Moved test panel from inline section to a dialog (bottom-sheet on mobile) with endpoint format selector (Anthropic / OpenAI) for verifying response format

## [0.9.24] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Self-referencing proxy loop**: SDK subprocess inherited `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=/proxy` from shell env, calling PPM's own proxy instead of real Anthropic API → infinite 401 loop. Now detects and strips self-referencing proxy URL and paired API key from SDK env.

## [0.9.22] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **SDK internal 401 retry loop stuck**: SDK retries 401 errors 10x with exponential backoff using same expired token (~2 min stuck at "Thinking..."). Now intercepts `api_retry` on first 401, refreshes token immediately, and if refresh fails (e.g. temporary account with no refresh token), switches to a different account instantly.
- **Auto-refresh spam for temporary accounts**: Accounts without refresh token triggered auto-refresh every 5 min, failing every time. Now skips them in the auto-refresh loop.

## [0.9.20] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **SDK retry hangs after token refresh**: All 4 retry paths (auth refresh + rate limit, in streaming and result events) used a stale `sdkId` resolved once at function start — for first messages this equals the PPM UUID which the SDK doesn't recognize, causing `query()` to hang forever. Now re-resolves session mapping before each retry and pushes `firstMsg` when no SDK session exists yet.
- **Workspace layout lost on new device**: Fetch server workspace BEFORE `setActiveProject` so `switchProject` picks up server data instead of creating an empty layout with a new timestamp

## [0.9.19] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Proxy for OAuth accounts**: OAuth tokens (Claude Max/Pro) now route through SDK `query()` bridge instead of direct API forwarding, which was returning rate_limit_error. API key accounts still use direct forwarding.

### Added
- **SDK proxy bridge** (`proxy-sdk-bridge.ts`): Translates Anthropic Messages API requests into Agent SDK calls for OAuth accounts, supporting both streaming SSE and non-streaming JSON responses with account rotation

## [0.9.16] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Debug button on iPad**: Use `ClipboardItem` pattern so Safari preserves user gesture through async fetch — previously clipboard write failed silently
- **Teammate-message tags**: Strip `<teammate-message>` XML tags from session history at backend level and chat text display
- **TeamCreate output**: Handle content-block array format in TeamCreate output extraction

## [0.9.10] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Agent Team UI**: Real-time team monitoring with REST API, WebSocket events, and popover UI
  - REST endpoints: `GET /api/teams`, `GET /api/teams/:name`, `DELETE /api/teams/:name`
  - WS: detect TeamCreate, fs.watch inbox changes, broadcast team_detected/team_inbox/team_updated
  - Chat input: team button with unread pulse badge, activity popover with member status + message timeline
  - AI Settings: team list with delete confirmation below Agent Teams toggle
- **Git worktree management**: Create/delete worktrees with dialog UI, worktree panel, service + routes
- **Touch tab drag**: Touch device support for tab dragging, split-drop overlay improvements

### Security
- Team name allowlist regex prevents path traversal on all team endpoints
- CSS color sanitization in team message rendering

## [0.9.8] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Fullscreen usage overlay**: Account cards now fill entire viewport as a no-scroll grid overlay instead of just expanding height with scroll
- **Provider + Settings button merged**: Combined provider badge and AI Settings into a single clickable button in chat toolbar

### Removed
- Unused `contextWindowPct` display from chat toolbar (was already non-functional)

## [0.9.7] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **File download**: Browser-native single file download from file tree context menu and editor toolbar
- **Folder zip download**: Stream folder contents as zip archive (excludes `.git`, `node_modules`)
- **Download tokens**: Short-lived one-time tokens (30s TTL) for secure browser-initiated downloads
- **Shared error-status helper**: Extracted `errorStatus()` to `src/server/helpers/error-status.ts`

### Security
- Download tokens scoped to `/files/raw` and `/files/download/zip` paths only
- Path traversal protection with trailing slash check

## [0.9.6] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Touch device hover buttons**: Buttons hidden behind `hover:` are now always visible on iPad/touch devices using `@media (hover: hover)` detection instead of breakpoint-based hiding — fixes invisible action buttons across git panel, chat history, project list, session picker, tabs, and more (14 files)

## [0.9.5] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **Streaming session survives FE disconnect**: Active chat sessions no longer killed when iPad sleeps or browser disconnects — agent runs to completion, cleanup only applies to idle sessions
- **Instant WS reconnect on wake**: Added `visibilitychange` listener so WebSocket reconnects immediately when page becomes visible instead of waiting for exponential backoff

### Changed
- **Mobile nav layout**: Updated mobile navigation layout

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **ext-database adaptive theme**: Replace hardcoded Catppuccin Mocha dark theme with light/dark adaptive CSS using `prefers-color-scheme` and shadcn zinc palette (table viewer + query panel)

### Added
- **ext-database connection management**: Edit, delete, test, export, import connections via commands (matching builtin viewer features)
- **ext-database tree view groups**: Connections grouped by group name, readonly 🔒 indicator, row counts on table nodes
- **ext-database color & readonly**: Add connection flow now collects group name, color, and readonly toggle

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Session context loss on token refresh**: Auth refresh and rate-limit account switching now resume the existing SDK session instead of starting a fresh one, preserving all conversation context (tool calls, thinking, etc.)

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Mobile input layout**: Reorder buttons (attach → textarea → mic → send) for better thumb reach
- **Desktop input layout**: Move mic button next to send button for consistent grouping
- **Usage panel fullscreen**: Add fullscreen toggle for Usage & Accounts panel when multiple accounts present, with grid layout in fullscreen mode

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-03

**"Open Platform"** — Multi-provider AI, MCP management, and extension architecture.

### Added — Extension System
- **Extension architecture (Phase 1-6)**: VSCode-compatible npm extensions with Bun Worker isolation, RPC protocol, state persistence, and contribution registry
- **@ppm/vscode-compat API shim**: commands, window (showInformationMessage, showErrorMessage, showQuickPick, showInputBox, createTreeView, createWebviewPanel, createStatusBarItem), workspace, EventEmitter
- **Extension UI components**: StatusBar items, TreeView with color dots/badges/actions, WebviewPanel (iframe sandbox), QuickPick/InputBox dialogs
- **WS bridge**: Real-time extension↔browser communication for tree updates, command execution, webview messaging
- **ext-database extension**: Database viewer with connection tree (color dots, PG/DB badges, action buttons), table viewer webview (data grid, inline editing, pagination, SQL panel), add connection flow
- **Extension Manager UI**: Install/uninstall/enable/disable extensions in Settings, dev-link for local development
- **CLI support**: `ppm ext install`, `ppm ext dev-link`, extension lifecycle management

### Added — Multi-Provider AI
- **Provider interface**: `AIProvider` with optional capabilities (`abortQuery?`, `getMessages?`, `listSessionsByDir?`)
- **CliProvider base class**: Abstract base for CLI-spawning providers (Cursor, Codex, Gemini)
- **Cursor CLI integration**: `CursorCliProvider` with NDJSON streaming, event mapping, history reader, workspace trust auto-retry
- **Provider selector UI**: Choose provider when creating chat sessions

### Added — MCP Management
- **MCP server CRUD**: REST API, SQLite storage, Settings UI, add/edit/delete servers
- **Auto-import**: Reads `~/.claude.json` on first access, skips existing/invalid entries
- **SDK integration**: Servers passed as `mcpServers`, tools auto-allowed via `mcp__*` wildcard

### Added — Other
- **Rate-limit auto-retry**: SDK retries on rate_limit/server_error with exponential backoff (15s, 30s, 60s) up to 3 attempts
- **Account rate-limit switching**: Auto-switch to next account on rate limit, skip 5hr-exhausted accounts
- **Increased max turns**: Default maxTurns bumped from 100 to 1000

### Fixed
- **Streaming auth loop**: Auth errors break streaming loop, cooldown account, tear down session
- **Streaming session resource leak**: `finally` block properly closes SDK subprocess and generator
- **Session mapping on resume**: Preserve existing sdk_id mapping to prevent orphaning JSONL history
- **Extension broadcast**: Contributions update broadcast on activate/deactivate
- **Extension webview**: Open tab when extension creates a webview panel
- **Extension auto-activate**: Auto-activate after dev-link install

## [0.8.94] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Session JSONL "not found" after disconnect/restart**: Debug endpoint relied on in-memory `projectPath` which was lost when session cleanup timer expired or server restarted. Now persists `project_path` in `session_map` DB table (migration 11) and falls back to DB lookup when in-memory state is gone.
- **Session mapping missing project info**: `setSessionMapping` now saves `projectName` and `projectPath` at both session creation and SDK init, ensuring resumed sessions can locate their JSONL files.

## [0.8.93] - 2026-04-02

### Removed
- **Cloud upgrade command**: Removed remote upgrade trigger from cloud — upgrade is now local-only (CLI `ppm upgrade` or UI banner)

## [0.8.92] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Fork UX**: Forked session now shows conversation history up to the fork point, puts the forked user message in input for editing instead of auto-sending
- **Fork at first message**: Forking the first user message creates a fresh empty session instead of erroring

## [0.8.91] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Session delete cleanup**: Deleting a session now removes JSONL files, DB mappings, titles, and pins; kills orphaned CLI processes
- **Mid-message fork**: Fork a session at a specific message via `forkAtMessage()` SDK capability with dynamic import
- **Compact handling**: Detect SDK compact events (`status`/`compact_boundary`) and forward "compacting..." status to frontend
- **Change password UI**: Settings panel for changing password with current/new password fields

### Fixed
- **Orphaned session on fork failure**: Restructured fork route to create PPM session only after SDK fork succeeds
- **Compact status stale badge**: Reset `compactStatus` on session change to prevent stale "compacting..." indicator
- **Cloud heartbeat device name**: Include device name in heartbeat payloads for cloud sync
- **Upgrade banner compact**: Reduced padding and fixed mobile overlap with device name badge

## [0.8.90] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Upgrade banner height**: Reduced padding and button sizes for a more compact banner
- **Mobile banner overlap**: Device name badge now shifts down when upgrade banner is visible, preventing overlap on mobile

## [0.8.89] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Account delete button**: Trash icon on each account card in Usage & Accounts panel with overlay confirmation popup
- **Expired account UX**: Expired temporary accounts (no refresh token) are dimmed, toggle/export hidden — only delete available

### Fixed
- **Account panel showing all accounts**: Usage & Accounts panel now always displays all accounts including expired temporary ones (previously filtered out)
- **MCP config table missing**: `McpConfigService.list()` gracefully returns empty object when `mcp_servers` table doesn't exist yet
- **Account error logging**: Consistent error message formatting in auto-refresh and pre-flight refresh logs

## [0.8.88] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Multi-provider architecture**: Generic AI provider system — `AIProvider` interface, `CliProvider` base class, `ProviderRegistry`, Cursor CLI integration with NDJSON streaming
- **MCP server management**: Configure Model Context Protocol servers via Settings UI — SQLite storage, REST API (CRUD + import), SDK integration with `mcp__*` wildcard
- **SDK streaming input**: Persistent `AsyncGenerator`-based chat with message channel pattern replacing one-shot queries

### Fixed
- **SDK process leak**: Prevent orphaned SDK processes on WebSocket disconnect and cancel
- **Cursor history**: Filter out `<user_info>` system context messages from imported sessions

## [0.8.87] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Session message loss on auth retry**: OAuth token expiry mid-query (e.g. during long bash commands) caused retry to create a new SDK session, overwriting the session mapping and losing all prior messages. Retry now resumes existing session instead.
- **Session CWD fallback to homedir**: `resumeSession()` didn't restore `projectPath` from SDK metadata, causing queries to use `$HOME` as CWD and JSONL to be stored under wrong project. Now extracts `cwd` from SDK session data.

## [0.8.85] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Connection lost overlay**: Full-screen overlay when API unreachable for >15s — tunnel mode links to PPM Cloud for new URL, localhost mode shows restart hint

### Fixed
- **Double-Shift command palette**: Only triggers when Shift pressed alone — no longer fires during Shift+key combos (uppercase typing, shortcuts)

## [0.8.84] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Account import overwrite**: Import now updates tokens for existing accounts even when they already have a (possibly expired/corrupt) refresh token — previously skipped, causing "0 imported"
- **Tunnel probe adopted PID**: Supervisor now monitors adopted tunnel processes and respawns if they die

### Added
- **Account rotation settings**: Settings gear icon in Usage & Accounts panel for rotation/retry config

## [0.8.83] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Account label desync**: Status bar now shows the actual streaming account label (real-time) instead of stale `lastPickedId` from usage polling — matches "via X" shown in chat messages when using multi-account round-robin

## [0.8.82] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Thinking block auto-scroll**: Thinking content now auto-scrolls to bottom during streaming using `StickToBottom`
- **Expandable recent sessions**: "Show more" / "Show less" button on chat welcome and empty panel — fetches up to 20 sessions, shows 5 initially

## [0.8.81] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Usage polling**: Re-wire `startUsagePolling()` into server startup — accidentally removed during supervisor refactor, causing prod to never auto-fetch usage limits (only manual refresh worked)

## [0.8.80] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Cloud command ack**: Device sends `command_ack` immediately when receiving a cloud command, before processing — allows cloud to confirm receipt and update UI

## [0.8.79] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Chat welcome screen**: New chat tabs now show pinned and recent sessions (same as empty panel) instead of a bare placeholder — quick access to continue previous conversations

## [0.8.78] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Cloud version reporting**: Supervisor heartbeat now reads version from running server child (via `status.json`) instead of its own captured constant — after `ppm restart` or `bunx @hienlh/ppm@latest restart`, cloud dashboard correctly reflects the updated version

## [0.8.77] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Deterministic tab IDs**: Tabs now use `{type}:{identifier}` format (e.g., `editor:src/index.ts`) instead of random UUIDs — enables deduplication, shareable URLs, and cross-device persistence
- **Type-based URLs**: URLs reflect tab content — `/project/my-app/editor/src/index.ts`, `/project/my-app/chat/claude-agent-sdk/session-abc`
- **Backend workspace sync**: New `workspace_state` table (DB v10) with GET/PUT `/api/project/:name/workspace` endpoints — tab layout persists server-side with per-project debounce and latest-wins merge
- **Deep linking**: Opening a URL auto-restores workspace from server and focuses the target tab
- **Split-duplicate support**: Same file can open in multiple panels using `@panel-id` suffix on non-singleton tab types

### Changed
- **URL format**: From `/project/{name}/tab/{randomId}` to `/project/{name}/{type}/{path}` — old random-ID URLs gracefully ignored
- **Tab migration**: `migrateTabIds()` automatically converts old random tab IDs to deterministic format on project load
- **Singleton dedup**: Only `git-graph` and `settings` tabs are globally deduplicated; editor/chat/terminal tabs allow split duplicates

## [0.8.76] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **SDK error messages**: 500/5xx server errors and 429 rate-limits now show correct user-facing messages instead of confusing "unknown API error" with debug instructions
- **Session title on resume**: Prioritize DB-stored title when resuming a chat session

## [0.8.75] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- **Tunnel always enabled**: `ppm start` now always starts Cloudflare tunnel — `--share` flag deprecated (still accepted, no-op)

## [0.8.74] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Cloud WS reconnect loop**: Stale WebSocket closure handlers from replaced connections no longer reset module state
- **Cloud WS auth race**: Delay heartbeat/queue flush 500ms after auth to let server complete async DB auth — prevents 4002 rejection

## [0.9.0-beta.10] - 2026-03-31

### Merged from main (0.8.69 → 0.8.72)
- **Supervisor state machine**: States `running → paused → upgrading` with promise-based wait/resume
- **Cloud WebSocket client**: Persistent WS connection replacing HTTP heartbeat — auto-reconnect with backoff
- **Remote commands via Cloud**: Supervisor handles restart/stop/upgrade/resume/status via Cloud WS
- **Pin/Save sessions**: Pin important chat sessions to top of history — persisted in DB across devices
- **Editor breadcrumb scrolling**: Enable scrolling in breadcrumb dropdown menus

## [0.9.0-beta.9] - 2026-03-31

### Merged from main (0.8.68)
- **Hot-reload timer leak**: Background polling timers (usage fetch, account refresh, cloud heartbeat) leaked on Bun `--hot` reload — module-level vars reset but old timers kept running. Moved timer refs to `globalThis` to survive reloads.

## [0.9.0-beta.8] - 2026-03-30

## [0.8.72] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Supervisor state machine**: States `running → paused → upgrading` with promise-based wait/resume. Supervisor pauses after 10 consecutive crashes, resumes via `ppm restart --force` or SIGUSR2
- **Cloud WebSocket client**: Persistent WS connection from supervisor to PPM Cloud replacing HTTP heartbeat — auto-reconnect with exponential backoff + jitter, 60s heartbeat, 50-message offline queue
- **Remote commands via Cloud**: Supervisor handles restart/stop/upgrade/resume/status commands received from Cloud WS
- **`ppm restart --force`**: Resume a paused supervisor (crashed too many times)
- **Status CLI state display**: `ppm status` shows paused/upgrading state with reason, timestamp, and last crash error

### Changed
- **Foreground mode removed**: `ppm start` no longer accepts `-f`/`--foreground` — always runs as supervised daemon
- **Heartbeat via WS**: Cloud heartbeat migrated from HTTP polling (5min) to WebSocket (60s), includes `appVersion`, `serverPid`, `uptime`

### Fixed
- **Upgrade failure recovery**: `selfReplace` failure now correctly resets state from "upgrading" back to "running" and notifies Cloud

## [0.8.71] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Pin/Save sessions**: Pin important chat sessions to always appear at the top of history, empty state, and session picker — persisted in DB across devices
- Mobile-friendly: pin/rename/delete buttons always visible on mobile, hover-reveal on desktop

### Fixed
- Fixed duplicate import in chat routes
- Fixed session action buttons misaligned when date column has variable width

## [0.8.70] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Recent chats on empty state**: When no tabs are open, show up to 5 recent chat sessions for quick access — click to reopen directly

## [0.8.69] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Auth 401 auto-retry**: Detect 401 errors returned as assistant text content (SDK doesn't always set error field) — refresh OAuth token and retry with fresh session automatically instead of showing raw error to user
- **Result-level 401 retry**: 401 in SDK result events now triggers token refresh + retry (previously only refreshed without retrying)

### Added
- **Account retry notification**: FE shows inline status when auth retry happens (e.g. "↻ Token refreshed — retrying with **Alex**...")
- **Session debug button**: Bug icon in chat toolbar copies session IDs + JSONL path to clipboard for quick debugging

## [0.8.68] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **SDK process leak**: Prevent claude-agent-sdk subprocess leak on WS disconnect and cancel — cleanup timer now starts regardless of streaming state, orphaned sessions cleaned up in 30s, abortQuery fully teardowns subprocess

### Merged from main (0.8.65–0.8.67)
- **CSV cell word wrap**: Wrap toggle applies to CSV table cells
- **CSV inline editing**: Cell editor upgraded to auto-resizing textarea with multi-line support
- **Auto-upgrade port conflict**: Supervisor self-replace prevents crash-restart loop
- **Editor breadcrumb bar**: VSCode-style path breadcrumb with nested dropdown navigation
- **Editor toolbar**: Contextual actions — Markdown Edit/Preview, CSV Table/Raw, Word Wrap
- **CSV table preview**: `@tanstack/react-table` viewer with virtual scrolling and inline editing
- **Chat session titles**: Persist in PPM DB to prevent SDK from overwriting user-set titles
- **Chat abort error**: Suppress abort error toast on user cancel

## [0.9.0-beta.7] - 2026-03-27

### Merged from main
- **Usage polling dedup**: Concurrent `pollOnce` calls share single in-flight fetch
- **429 cooldown floor**: Min 60s cooldown on 429 responses
- **Browser preview tests**: Unit tests (12) + integration test (6) for tunnel routes

## [0.9.0-beta.6] - 2026-03-27

### Merged from main
- **Browser preview tab**: Localhost preview via per-port Cloudflare Quick Tunnels. Enter port → tunnel starts → iframe loads tunnel URL. Ghost cleanup every 30s. All tunnels killed on shutdown.
- **Voice input**: Mic button in chat, `Cmd+Shift+V` shortcut, command palette entry
- **Voice input stops on send**: Auto-stops recognition when message sent

## [0.9.0-beta.5] - 2026-03-27

### Merged
- Consolidated `feat/streaming-input-migration` into `beta`

## [0.9.0-beta.3] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Streaming input migration**: Chat system migrated from per-message `query()` to SDK-recommended persistent `AsyncGenerator` streaming input — follow-up messages `yield` into a single long-lived query instead of spawning new subprocesses
- **Message priority**: Follow-up messages support `now` (interrupt), `next` (queue, default), `later` priority via SDK `streamInput` — PriorityToggle UI visible during streaming
- **Image attachment support**: Messages can include base64 images (png/jpeg/gif/webp, max 5 images, max 5MB each) passed through to SDK `MessageParam` content blocks
- **Persistent event consumer**: `startSessionConsumer()` runs for session lifetime, processing events across multiple turns — replaces per-message `runStreamLoop()`

### Changed
- **Cancel = interrupt**: Cancel button now calls `query.interrupt()` (session stays alive) instead of `query.close()` (killed subprocess)
- **No more abort-and-replace**: Follow-up messages push into existing generator via `pushMessage()` instead of aborting current stream and starting new query
- **Crash auto-recovery**: Streaming session cleanup on crash, next message auto-recovers by creating new session

### Fixed
- **First-message images dropped**: Images on initial message now passed through `startSessionConsumer` to SDK
- **Double done event**: `yieldedDone` flag prevents duplicate done broadcast on session end
- **Retry channel leak**: Old message channel properly closed (`controller.done()`) before retry
- **abortQuery fallback cleanup**: Streaming session cleaned up when `interrupt()` unavailable

## [0.9.0-beta.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Chat input drops uploading files on send**: Pressing send while files are still uploading now queues the message and auto-sends once all uploads complete, instead of silently dropping in-progress attachments. Send button shows spinner when queued; clicking again cancels.
- **Ping interval leak**: `evictClient()` clears ping interval when broadcast error removes client
- **Black screen after closing all tabs**: Panel auto-close used `Object.keys(panels)` which counted keep-alive panels from other projects — last panel got removed, leaving empty grid. Now uses `grid.flat().length` to count only current-project panels. Added defensive recovery in PanelLayout for empty grid.

## [0.8.59] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Usage polling chain breaking permanently**: `startUsagePolling` recursive setTimeout chain now uses `Promise.race` with 60s timeout guard and `try/finally` — if `pollOnce` hangs or rejects, `scheduleNext` still runs
- **OAuth token refresh hanging forever**: `refreshAccessToken` fetch now has 15s `AbortSignal.timeout` — prevents blocking usage polling and auto-refresh when Anthropic OAuth is slow/unresponsive

### Changed
- **Account selector sustainability scoring**: Raise cap from 1.0 to 2.0 (scaled /2) so accounts with imminent weekly reset score higher than accounts with more remaining capacity but far-off resets

## [0.8.58] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Stale upgrade banner**: Banner showed old version (e.g. v0.8.56) even after upgrading past it. Route now compares availableVersion > currentVersion before returning. Supervisor clears stale availableVersion on startup.

## [0.8.57] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Self-replace port conflict**: Old supervisor's server held port while new supervisor tried to bind it, causing "port in use" crash. Now kills server/tunnel children and waits 500ms before spawning new supervisor.

## [0.8.56] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Account card footer**: Token expiry countdown and status label (long-lived/temp/expired/key) with color coding; hover for explanation

## [0.8.55] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Account management in Usage panel**: Add/Export/Import accounts directly from the Usage & Accounts panel — no more navigating to Settings
- **Account dialogs**: Extracted reusable Add, Export, Import dialog components
- **Horizontal account cards**: Account cards scroll horizontally with snap points when multiple accounts exist
- **Per-account export**: Export button on each OAuth account card opens export dialog with that account pre-selected
- **Default export password**: Export/import uses default password `ppm-hienlh` when password field left empty
- **Operation feedback**: Success message banner with 4s auto-dismiss after add/export/import operations
- **Image overlay**: Zoom preview overlay component for images (mermaid diagrams etc.)

### Fixed
- **SDK user message rendering**: System text in SDK-generated user messages (tool_result/task-notification XML) no longer renders as user chat bubbles
- **Hot-reload port check**: `bun --hot` reload no longer exits with "port in use" — detects hot-reload mode via globalThis flag
- **File listing order**: Command palette file listing uses BFS instead of DFS so root-level files appear before the limit

### Changed
- **Settings**: Removed Accounts category from settings (moved to Usage panel)

## [0.8.54] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Auto-upgrade feature**: Supervisor checks npm registry every 15min for new versions
- **Upgrade UI banner**: Dismissible banner with one-click upgrade button, dark mode support, 44x44px touch targets
- **Upgrade API**: `GET /api/upgrade` (status) + `POST /api/upgrade/apply` (install + supervisor self-replace)
- **`ppm upgrade` CLI**: `--check` flag for version check, auto-detects bun/npm install method
- **Supervisor self-replace**: After upgrade, spawns new supervisor → waits for PID in status.json → old exits gracefully
- **Integration tests**: 9 tests for upgrade service (compareSemver, checkForUpdate, API routes)
- **`PPM_HOME` env var**: Override `~/.ppm` directory for test isolation

### Fixed
- **Tests killing production PPM**: Test cleanup read shared `~/.ppm/status.json` and killed all PIDs including running prod. Now uses isolated temp dirs
- **SDK provider tests**: Fixed empty response assertion, missing `/tmp/my-project` dir, success subtype with 0 turns
- **Account service tests**: `importEncrypted()` made async but tests didn't await — added async/await + updated return type
- **Push routes test**: VAPID key empty due to DB reset by other tests — added `beforeEach` to reinit

### Changed
- **Test isolation**: `supervisor-resilience` and `daemon-tunnel-reuse` tests use `PPM_HOME` temp dirs instead of shared `~/.ppm`

## [0.8.53] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Process supervisor**: Long-lived parent process manages server + tunnel children with auto-restart on crash (exponential backoff 1s→60s, resets after 5min stable)
- **Tunnel resilience**: Auto-respawn cloudflared on death, extract new URL, sync to cloud immediately
- **Server health watchdog**: GET /api/health every 30s, kills hung server after 3 consecutive failures
- **Tunnel URL probe**: GET tunnelUrl/api/health every 2min, regenerates tunnel after 2 failures
- **SIGUSR2 graceful restart**: `ppm restart` signals supervisor to restart server only (tunnel stays alive, no backoff)
- **Count-based exception exit**: 3+ uncaught exceptions in 1 minute triggers exit for clean supervisor restart
- **Integration tests**: 8 tests covering supervisor spawn, crash recovery, SIGUSR2 restart, backoff behavior

### Changed
- **Daemon mode**: `ppm start` now spawns supervisor process instead of server directly
- **macOS autostart**: KeepAlive changed from conditional (SuccessfulExit=false) to unconditional
- **Linux autostart**: Restart policy changed from `on-failure` to `always`
- **`ppm stop`**: Kills supervisor PID first (cascades to children), 2s grace period
- **`ppm status`**: Shows supervisor PID and alive status
- **`ppm restart`**: Uses SIGUSR2 to supervisor for server-only restart

## [0.8.52] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Command palette IME conflict**: Double-Shift no longer falsely triggers command palette while typing with IME (Vietnamese Telex/VNI, Chinese, Japanese, Korean input methods). Tracks `compositionstart`/`compositionend` events and checks `e.isComposing`

## [0.8.51] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **API Key / Token field**: New input in AI Settings to set a direct API key — overrides account rotation and env vars. Masked in responses (shows `••••` + last 4 chars)
- **Anthropic API proxy**: Forward Anthropic Messages API requests through PPM with account token rotation. Endpoints: `POST /proxy/v1/messages`, `POST /proxy/v1/messages/count_tokens`
- **Proxy settings UI**: Enable/disable proxy, manage auth key, view tunnel URL and request count
- **Proxy settings API**: `GET/PUT /api/settings/proxy` for proxy configuration
- **Auth priority**: Settings `api_key` > account token > shell env `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` > block project .env
- **Proxy tests**: 18 integration tests for proxy API, 4 unit tests for buildQueryEnv priority, 3 unit tests for api_key masking

### Changed
- **Message list**: Removed unused pinned message feature

## [0.8.50] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Export token invalidation**: Export no longer auto-refreshes tokens by default — previously, every export called `refreshBeforeExport` which invalidated all previously shared tokens. Now opt-in via "Refresh tokens before export" toggle

### Added
- **Export refresh toggle**: New checkbox in export dialog — "Refresh tokens before export" (default off). Info box explains trade-offs: safe share (green) vs refresh-first (amber) vs full transfer (red)
- **Token test dialog** (dev-only): Test access token validity per account, simulate multi-round export with pre/post/exported token comparison. Hidden in production builds via `import.meta.env.DEV`
- **Test API endpoints** (dev): `POST /api/accounts/test-export`, `POST /api/accounts/test-raw-token`, `POST /api/accounts/:id/test-token`

## [0.8.49] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Auth error backoff**: `onAuthError` now uses 5-minute base cooldown (exponential up to 30min) instead of 1s rate-limit backoff — prevents rapid retry loops on dead/rejected accounts
- **No permanent disable**: Auth errors never permanently disable accounts — cooldown allows recovery from transient issues (subscription lapse, org changes, API hiccups)

## [0.8.48] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Account auth errors**: Use cooldown instead of permanent disable on `authentication_failed` / 401 — auth issues can be transient (subscription lapse, org changes, API hiccups)
- **SDK refresh safety**: Pass `disableOnFail=false` in SDK error handlers — prevents `refreshAccessToken` from disabling accounts as side effect during auto-retry

## [0.8.47] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Usage polling**: Use `ensureFreshToken()` in background usage poll — prevents 401 from expired tokens causing auto-fetch to always fail
- **Temp accounts**: Don't auto-disable temporary accounts (no refresh token) when token expires — they now expire naturally and get cleaned up after 7 days
- **Account export**: `refreshBeforeExport` no longer disables accounts as a side effect on refresh failure

## [0.8.46] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Account delete**: Replace `window.confirm()` with shadcn Dialog for delete confirmation — native confirm was silently blocked in WebView/embedded contexts

## [0.8.45] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Account export**: Keep refresh token on source machine when exporting with full transfer — auto-cleared only when token becomes invalid

## [0.8.44] - 2026-03-25

### Improved
- **Sticky user messages**: Rewrite as JS scroll-based pinned header with push-out transition (react-listview-sticky-header style) — CSS sticky didn't work with StickToBottom
- **Pinned bubble style**: Pinned header matches user bubble appearance (rounded, bordered, shadow, line-clamp-2, expand/collapse)
- **User bubble cleanup**: Remove wrapper div nesting, fork button now absolute top-right, eliminate extra bottom spacing
- **Horizontal overflow**: Fix always-visible horizontal scrollbar by moving overflow-x-hidden to StickToBottom wrapper

## [0.8.43] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Sticky user messages**: Only the last user message sticks to top — prevents multiple messages overlapping
- **npm package**: Exclude screenshot PNG files from published package

## [0.8.41] - 2026-03-25

### Improved
- **User chat bubble**: Full-width layout, 2-line collapse with expand/collapse, compact attachment chips
- **Sticky user messages**: Most recent user message sticks to top while scrolling through assistant responses
- **System tag rendering**: Claude system tags (`<system-reminder>`, `<claudeMd>`, etc.) rendered as collapsible badges instead of raw text
- **Markdown images**: Local file path images in assistant markdown now load via authenticated `/api/fs/raw` endpoint
- **Raw file endpoint**: New `GET /api/fs/raw?path=` for serving binary files (images, etc.)

### Refactored
- **Tunnel service**: Moved status file patching into service layer, cleaned up route handler

## [0.8.40] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Windows SDK hang**: Force `node` executable instead of `bun` for SDK subprocess on Windows to prevent hangs
- **Windows test-tool**: Re-exec `test-tool.mjs` via Git Bash on Windows

### Removed
- **SDK patch system**: Remove `patch-sdk.mjs` and runtime patching — no longer needed with upstream SDK fixes

## [0.8.39] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Binary frontend missing**: Compiled binary now ships with `web/` assets in archive (`.tar.gz`/`.zip`). Server looks for `web/` next to binary when running in compiled mode.
- **Windows install**: Fix TLS 1.2, SSL revocation, and download hang issues in PowerShell installer

## [0.8.38] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Binary daemon crash**: Compiled binary failed to spawn daemon — was passing `run script.ts` args which only work with `bun` runtime. Now detects compiled binary mode and spawns correctly.

## [0.8.37] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Intel Mac AVX crash**: Use baseline x64 builds that work on all Intel CPUs (no AVX requirement)
- **Linux ARM64**: Add `ppm-linux-arm64` binary for Raspberry Pi / ARM servers

## [0.8.36] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Install script progress bar**: Show download progress during binary install
- **npm package size**: Exclude compiled binaries from npm tarball (154MB → ~20MB)

## [0.8.35] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Binary --version crash**: Fix `ENOENT: /$bunfs/package.json` error when running compiled binary — use static import instead of `readFileSync` so Bun embeds version at compile time
- **Install script upgrade check**: Check binary availability before downloading; show current vs new version and changelogs on upgrade; auto-add PATH to shell profile

## [0.8.34] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Remove stale YAML config references**: Update docs, help text, and architecture diagrams to reflect SQLite-based config storage — removes misleading `~/.ppm/config.yaml` references that could confuse users and AI assistants

## [0.8.33] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Settings redesign**: Replace flat accordion with two-level iOS Settings-style navigation — quick-access settings (Device Name, Theme) at top, category drill-down (AI, Notifications, Accounts, Shortcuts) with back button. Scales infinitely without overflow.
- **Notifications grouped**: Push notifications and Telegram settings combined under single Notifications category
- **Open Chat shortcut**: Default changed from Cmd+Shift+L to Cmd+L

### Added
- **Auto-focus chat input**: Opening a new chat tab automatically focuses the message input

## [0.8.27] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Temporary export/import**: Exported accounts no longer include refresh tokens — imported accounts are temporary (~1h access-only). Prevents token rotation conflicts between machines.
- **Temporary account UI**: Shows "Temporary" badge for accounts without refresh token, "Expired" badge when expired. Expired temporary accounts cannot be re-enabled.
- **Auto-cleanup**: Expired temporary accounts (no refresh token) are automatically deleted after 7 days.
- **Export warning**: Export dialog now explains that exported accounts are temporary and the importing machine should login directly for permanent access.
- **Invalid refresh token cleanup**: When refresh fails with `invalid_grant`, clears the refresh token so the account becomes temporary (same lifecycle rules apply: can't re-enable when expired, auto-deleted after 7 days)
- **Skip expired accounts in usage**: Expired temporary accounts are excluded from usage polling and usage panel — no wasted API calls or UI clutter

## [0.8.24] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Import token rotation**: After importing accounts, immediately refresh OAuth tokens so the importing machine owns fresh tokens. Source machine's tokens will be invalidated by Anthropic's rotation — warns user in UI.

## [0.8.23] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Stop disabling accounts on background refresh failure**: Startup and background auto-refresh no longer disable accounts when refresh fails — only actual query-time failures disable accounts. Prevents all accounts being disabled after server restart.
- **Better refresh error logging**: Log response body from Anthropic when token refresh fails (was only logging status code)
- **Token state diagnostic logging**: Log `token_expires_in` before each SDK query for debugging auth issues

## [0.8.22] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **OAuth pre-flight token refresh**: Check token freshness before each SDK query and refresh proactively if expired or expiring within 60s
- **Auto-refresh on startup**: Run token refresh check immediately on server start instead of waiting 5 minutes for first interval
- **OAuth auto-refresh on auth failure**: Automatically refresh expired OAuth token and retry when SDK returns `authentication_failed`, instead of just showing error to user

## [0.8.21] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **OAuth auto-refresh on auth failure**: Automatically refresh expired OAuth token and retry when SDK returns `authentication_failed`, instead of just showing error to user

## [0.8.20] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **SDK patch resolution**: Use `fileURLToPath` instead of `new URL().pathname` for cross-platform SDK path resolution; add debug logging for bunx SDK resolution

## [0.8.19] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **SDK patch for bunx**: Apply SDK patches (drain, await prompt, readline) at runtime before server start — `bunx` skips `postinstall` hooks so patches were never applied

### Changed
- **Settings UI**: Redesign from accordion to tabbed navigation (General, AI, Notifs, Accounts, Keys) with scroll areas and About section showing version

## [0.8.18] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Restart reliability**: Kill orphan processes holding the port via `lsof`/`netstat` (cross-platform), not just the PID from status.json — fixes restart failures when old server process outlives its PID record

## [0.8.17] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Account settings UI**: Add "Lowest usage" option to strategy selector (BE validation + FE type + dropdown)

## [0.8.16] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Git Graph default `⌘G` (was `⌘⇧G`), Terminal default `⌘'` (was `` ⌘` ``)
- **Command palette**: Show keyboard shortcut badges on action commands

## [0.8.15] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **Usage polling reliability**: Replace `setInterval` with recursive `setTimeout` to prevent overlap and timer death from unhandled async rejections; wrap `pollOnce` in try/catch

### Added
- **Lowest-usage account strategy**: New `lowest-usage` routing strategy picks account with lowest 5-hour utilization, skips accounts at 100% weekly/5hr, falls back gracefully when all exhausted

## [0.8.14] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **CLI error logging**: Always read stderr (even on exit code 0), log error event content to server logs for Windows CLI debugging

## [0.8.13] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Device name setting**: Editable device name in Settings UI — updates page title and syncs to PPM Cloud

## [0.8.12] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Execution mode setting**: Configurable `execution_mode` (sdk/cli) in Settings → AI Provider — replaces hardcoded Windows platform check

### Changed
- **claude-agent-sdk**: Bump from 0.2.76 to 0.2.81

## [0.8.11] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Windows dev workflow**: Replace shell `&` with `concurrently` for cross-platform dev script, run dev:server in foreground, use `--profile dev` for SQLite-based config
- **PowerShell daemon**: Fix `ArgumentList` rejecting empty strings by stripping trailing empties and using `_` placeholder

## [0.8.10] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Block project .env poisoning**: All auth env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) are now explicitly set in SDK subprocess env — prevents Claude SDK from falling back to project `.env` which may contain unrelated/invalid keys (root cause of indefinite SDK hang)

## [0.8.9] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Base URL setting**: Configurable `base_url` in Settings → AI Provider, injected as `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. Overrides shell env.

### Changed
- **Auth env priority**: PPM settings (accounts + base_url) > shell env. Project `.env` no longer read — prevents conflict with projects that use Claude API directly.

### Fixed
- **Env var diagnostics**: Timeout and error messages guide users to check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` env vars with exact debug commands
- **Auth source logging**: Log which source each auth var comes from — helps diagnose SDK hangs

## [0.8.6] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Actionable timeout error**: Timeout error now shows project path, exact `claude -p "hi"` debug command, and steps to check hooks/MCP/settings
- **SDK lifecycle logging**: All SDK `system` events (hook_started, init, etc.) now logged with full JSON — helps diagnose where SDK hangs

## [0.8.5] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Diagnostic error messages for project-specific failures**: When SDK returns `assistant error: unknown`, error now includes project path and exact `claude` CLI command to run for diagnosis
- **Full SDK event dump on error**: Log complete assistant message JSON for debugging (visible in server logs)
- **Removed broken session retry**: Retry-as-fresh-session didn't help since fresh sessions also fail for the same project — removed to avoid masking the real error

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Poisoned session auto-recovery**: When resuming an existing SDK session fails with an assistant error (e.g. `unknown`), automatically retry as a fresh session instead of hanging for minutes — fixes projects stuck on a bad session

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **WSL timeout diagnostics**: Connection timeout error now detects WSL environment and suggests specific DNS/proxy troubleshooting steps
- **No-credentials warning**: Log warning when no account and no API key in env — helps diagnose why SDK subprocess hangs

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Heartbeat during SDK connection**: Keep "Connecting... (Xs)" indicator alive until real content arrives — previously stopped by `account_info` event, causing misleading "thinking" state during 3-minute SDK failures
- **Unknown API error hint**: "API error: unknown" now shows actionable guidance (check connectivity, re-add account, new session)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Silent timeout on account decrypt failure**: When all account tokens fail decryption (e.g. different machine key in WSL), now shows actionable error instead of 120s silent timeout
- **SDK error extraction**: Use `errors: string[]` array per SDK spec instead of non-existent singular `error` field — previously swallowed error details
- **Assistant message error detection**: Handle `SDKAssistantMessage.error` field for `authentication_failed`, `billing_error`, `rate_limit`, `server_error` per SDK spec
- **Empty success detection**: Detect SDK returning `success` with 0 turns and no content as silent failure, surface guidance to user
- **Network error hints**: Add WSL-specific hints for ConnectionRefused, auth failures, and connectivity issues

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Permission mode selector**: 4 Claude Code modes (default/acceptEdits/plan/bypassPermissions) — per-session sticky mode with Shift+Tab cycling
- **System prompt customization**: Global "Additional Instructions" textarea in AI Settings, threaded to SDK
- **PreToolUse hook for permissions**: In-process hook handles tool approval for non-bypass modes — surfaces approval requests to frontend via WebSocket
- **Git graph overhaul**: Modular components, infinite scroll, and lane recycling for improved performance

### Improved
- **Permission mode defaults**: Global default permission mode configurable in AI Settings
- **Config validation**: System prompt max 10K chars, invalid permission_mode auto-sanitized
- **Windows CLI fallback**: `--append-system-prompt` flag support

### Fixed
- **Mode selector dropdown**: Click-outside handler no longer closes dropdown before selection registers
- **QR code dark theme**: White background with color-scheme:light to prevent dark mode inversion
- **Cloud sign-in from UI**: Device code flow for web-based cloud login
- **Cloud unlink/logout**: Confirm dialogs to prevent accidental disconnection

## [0.7.36] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Cloud & Share popover**: New unified popover in project bar replacing old Share button — sign in to PPM Cloud, link device, share tunnel, view QR code, open cloud dashboard — all in one place
- **Cloud server API**: `/api/cloud/status`, `/api/cloud/login`, `/api/cloud/link`, `/api/cloud/unlink` endpoints for web UI integration
- **Auto-share on link**: Linking device auto-starts tunnel if not already sharing

### Improved
- **Project bar cleanup**: Extracted 180+ lines of share logic into dedicated `cloud-share-popover.tsx` component

## [0.7.35] - 2026-03-23

### Improved
- **Cloud link auto-sync**: `ppm cloud link` detects active tunnel and sends heartbeat immediately — device shows online on cloud dashboard without restart

## [0.7.34] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Device code login**: `ppm cloud login --device-code` for remote terminals (PPM terminal, SSH, headless). Enter 6-char code at ppm.hienle.tech/verify from any browser.
- **Auto-detection**: CLI auto-picks browser flow on desktop, device code flow on remote sessions. Falls back to device code if browser fails.

## [0.7.33] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Cloud sync from UI**: Share button in web UI now triggers cloud heartbeat sync (previously only CLI `--share` flag worked)
- **Heartbeat cleanup**: Stopping tunnel from UI properly cleans up cloud heartbeat interval

## [0.7.32] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **PPM Cloud CLI**: `ppm cloud login/logout/link/unlink/status/devices` — connect PPM instances to PPM Cloud for device registry + tunnel URL sync
- **Auto-sync heartbeat**: `ppm start --share` automatically syncs tunnel URL to cloud every 5 minutes if device is linked
- **Cloud URL config**: `ppm config set cloud_url <url>` to use custom cloud instance

### Security
- Cloud auth files (`cloud-auth.json`, `cloud-device.json`) restricted to owner-only (chmod 0o600)
- XSS prevention in OAuth callback HTML
- Heartbeat interval cleanup prevents duplicate timers on restart

## [0.7.31] - 2026-03-23

### Improved
- **Restart message**: updated PPM terminal hint to "wait for auto-reconnect" instead of "reload the page" since web client reconnects automatically

## [0.7.30] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Restart from PPM terminal**: worker and restart command now ignore SIGHUP — killing the old server destroys the terminal PTY which sends SIGHUP to the process group, previously killing the worker before it could spawn the new server

## [0.7.29] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Auto-start on boot**: `ppm autostart enable/disable/status` registers PPM to start automatically via OS-native mechanisms — macOS launchd, Linux systemd, Windows Registry Run key
- **Cross-platform support**: auto-detects compiled binary vs bun runtime, resolves paths correctly on all platforms
- **VBScript hidden wrapper**: Windows auto-start runs PPM without visible console window
- **GitHub Actions CI**: test matrix for macOS, Linux, and Windows with unit + integration tests

### Technical
- 2-layer architecture: generator (pure functions, testable) + register (OS interaction)
- 40 unit tests + 20 integration tests (platform-specific with `describe.if`)
- KeepAlive/Restart-on-failure for crash recovery on all platforms

## [0.7.28] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Secure account export/import**: password-encrypted backup (scrypt + AES-256-GCM), selective account export, auto-refresh tokens before export
- **Import dialog**: inline error display for wrong password or corrupted backup

### Improved
- **Account cards**: compact 2-row layout, usage % inline, singular/plural "req(s)"
- **Test isolation**: bunfig.toml preload ensures all tests use in-memory DB (no more production DB writes)

### Fixed
- **Cross-machine account import**: tokens now properly re-encrypted with local machine key
- **Usage refresh spinner stuck**: refresh button no longer hangs when token decrypt fails

## [0.7.27] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Restart from PPM terminal**: restart spawns a detached worker process so it completes even when the server (and its terminals) are killed mid-restart
- **Restart result visibility**: restart command now polls for the worker's result and displays it inline; pre-restart message warns PPM terminal users to wait and reload
- **Restart server script path**: saved in `status.json` during `ppm start` to avoid ephemeral `bunx` cache path issues

## [0.7.26] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **First message stuck on "thinking"**: send `streaming_status` immediately before `resumeSession` so FE gets heartbeat feedback even when SDK session lookup is slow
- **WS message silently dropped**: queue messages sent while WebSocket is still CONNECTING, flush on open instead of dropping

### Improved
- Added timing logs for `resumeSession`, `runStreamLoop` start, first SDK event delay, and all dropped `safeSend` events for easier debugging

## [0.7.25] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Git status mobile scroll**: file rows no longer accidentally open context menu while scrolling — tap opens diff, long-press (~400ms) opens action menu, with `select-none` to prevent text selection

## [0.7.24] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **"In use" badge removed**: removed redundant "In use" label from active account card in usage panel
- **Scroll-to-bottom button overlap**: floating button no longer overlaps the chat input area

## [0.7.23] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Restart from PPM terminal**: restart command now spawns a detached worker process so it survives when the old server (and its terminals) are killed — previously running `ppm restart` inside a PPM terminal would kill the restart process itself before the new server could be spawned, causing persistent 502
- **Restart server script path**: save server entry script path in `status.json` during `ppm start` so restart always uses the stable installed location instead of a potentially ephemeral `bunx` cache path

## [0.7.22] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Mobile nav horizontal scroll**: tabs now scroll horizontally when many are open — added `min-w-0` to flex containers so `overflow-x-auto` works correctly

## [0.7.21] - 2026-03-22

### Improved
- **Usage refresh UX**: account cards stay visible during refresh instead of hiding behind "Loading..." text; changed accounts flash with a highlight animation for 1.5s so users can easily spot updated values

## [0.7.20] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **Usage panel initial flash**: panel no longer briefly shows single-account view before loading multi-account cards
- **Usage panel reload**: clicking refresh now correctly re-fetches all account usages after server finishes polling Anthropic API, fixing race condition where stale DB snapshots were read before refresh completed
- **Clipboard API fallback**: export/import account data now works on mobile Safari — export falls back to file download, import shows a paste dialog when clipboard is unavailable
- **Duplicate account import**: import now skips accounts with matching email, not just matching ID — prevents duplicates when importing across devices

## [0.7.17] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Merged usage & accounts panels**: combined the separate Accounts and Usage panels above chat input into a single "Usage & Accounts" panel with account controls (toggle, verify, profile) inline on each usage card
- **Consolidated action buttons**: Copy/Paste/Export/Import buttons in settings grouped into a "More" dropdown menu
- **Delete button**: replaced emoji `✕` with Lucide `X` icon
- **Touch targets**: increased icon button sizes for better mobile usability
- **Auto-dismiss toasts**: success/error messages in settings now auto-clear after 4 seconds
- **ON/OFF text → Switch**: quick panel account toggles now use consistent Switch component

### Fixed
- **Usage timestamp timezone**: SQLite `datetime('now')` returns UTC without `Z` suffix causing 7h offset in non-UTC timezones — now appends `Z` for correct parsing
- **Stale "last fetched" time**: usage refresh no longer shows old timestamp when data hasn't changed — `recorded_at` is touched on every successful fetch
- **Cascade delete**: deleting an account now removes its usage history snapshots from `claude_limit_snapshots`

## [0.7.16] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Account indicator on messages**: assistant messages now show `via <account label>` below the response when multi-account mode is active

## [0.7.15] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **npm package**: exclude `.env.test` from published tarball

## [0.7.14] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Explorer gitignore dimming**: files/folders matched by `.gitignore` display at reduced opacity in the file tree
- **Multi-account E2E tests**: real AI call tests for SDK and CLI using token from `.env.test`; covers default auth, platform detection (macOS/Windows), and decrypt error handling

### Fixed
- **Explorer .env access**: removed hardcoded `.env` block from file tree, directory browser, and file read/write — `.env` files are now visible and editable like any other file

## [0.7.13] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Account decrypt crash on different machine**: `getWithTokens` now catches decrypt errors (mismatched `account.key`) and returns `null` instead of crashing the API

## [0.7.12] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Account list not loading**: use `Promise.allSettled` so one failing API call doesn't prevent accounts from showing

## [0.7.11] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Account export/import**: pass auth token in API calls (was using raw `fetch` without `Authorization` header)

## [0.7.10] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- **Usage panel layout**: responsive grid (1–4 columns) replaces collapsible list for account usage cards
- **Usage data**: removed legacy fallback — each account shows only its own per-account data

### Removed
- **Health check polling**: removed `useHealthCheck` hook (5s `/api/health` ping + crash toast)

## [0.7.9] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Manual token input**: add Claude accounts via dialog — supports OAuth tokens (`claude setup-token`) and API keys with auto-detection
- **Per-account usage limits**: Usage Limits panel shows collapsible per-account sections with 5hr/weekly bars
- **Active account indicator**: chat header badge shows `[account label]`, account cards show "In use" badge and ring highlight
- **Inline usage bars**: compact 5h/Wk mini-bars on each account card in settings
- **API endpoints**: `GET /api/accounts/active`, `GET /api/accounts/usage`, `GET /api/accounts/:id/usage`, `POST /api/accounts`
- **DB migration v6**: `account_id` column on `claude_limit_snapshots` for per-account tracking

### Changed
- **Usage polling**: rewritten for multi-account with per-token 429 cooldown (respects `retry-after` header)
- **SDK env vars**: auto-detect token type — OAuth → `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, API key → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

## [0.7.8] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **AskUserQuestion answer text**: changed `text-accent` to `text-foreground` so the selected answer is clearly visible instead of muted

## [0.7.7] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Diff viewer loading forever**: `ResizeObserver` effect had empty deps `[]`, so it ran once at mount while the loading spinner was showing — `containerRef` was null, effect returned early, and Monaco never measured its container height after the API call completed; fixed by adding `loading`/`error` to the effect deps

## [0.7.6] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Diff viewer toolbar**: moved expand/word-wrap buttons into a fixed header bar (hidden on mobile); fixes toolbar being rendered outside the scroll container
- **Diff viewer empty state**: handles metadata-only diffs (file mode change, rename) where `parseDiff` returns no hunks — shows "No content changes" instead of blank screen

## [0.7.5] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Usage limit history (SQLite)**: Claude 5hr/weekly limit snapshots now persisted to `claude_limit_snapshots` table (migration v4) — inserts new row only when utilization or reset-time changes, auto-cleans records older than 7 days
- **Usage polling interval**: Changed from 60s to 2min; `GET /chat/usage?refresh=1` forces an immediate API fetch and waits before returning the fresh DB snapshot
- **FE reads from DB**: `refresh=0` reads latest snapshot directly from DB (no Anthropic API call); `refresh=1` waits for fresh fetch then reads DB

## [0.7.4] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Search: files to include filter** — filter search results by file/folder glob patterns (e.g. `*.ts`, `src/**`, `*.ts, *.tsx`); uses path-aware glob matching that supports `**` and path prefixes (unlike grep's `--include` which only matches filenames)
- **Search: replace input** — find & replace across files with "Replace All" button; applies the same case/word/regex options as the search query and shows replacement count on completion

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Mark as read**: `BellOff` button in chat toolbar clears notification badge for current session

### Fixed
- **Tab title badge timing**: Document title now updates immediately in background tabs using direct Zustand subscription instead of `useEffect` (which is throttled by browser when tab is hidden)
- **Tab title format**: Title now shows `{project} - {device} - PPM` pattern
- **Auto-clear on tab focus**: Notification badge clears automatically when switching back to browser or navigating to the active chat tab — no need to click the tab again
- **Left/right overflow badge direction**: Fixed incorrect badge side using `getBoundingClientRect()` instead of `offsetLeft` (which was relative to offsetParent, not scroll container)

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Tunnel URL sync**: `ppm start --share` tunnel URL now synced into `tunnelService` on daemon startup — Share button in web UI shows correct URL instead of treating tunnel as inactive and starting a duplicate

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Session rename persistence**: Use SDK `customTitle` field instead of volatile `summary` when listing/resuming sessions, so custom titles survive reloads
- **Session rename ID resolution**: Resolve PPM UUID → SDK session ID and pass project dir when renaming, ensuring SDK finds the correct session file
- **SDK crash recovery**: When SDK subprocess exits with code 1 during session resume, automatically retry as a fresh session instead of showing a cryptic error

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Notification system**: Zustand-based notification store with per-session tracking, unread counts in document title, and SVG favicon badge
- **Notification sounds**: 3 distinct Web Audio API tones — ascending chime (done), urgent alert (approval), soft triplet (question)
- **Notification badge colors**: red (approval_request), amber (question), blue (done) on tabs, project avatars, and scroll arrows
- **Telegram notifications**: Bot API integration with offline-only delivery, SSRF-safe bot token validation, HTML message formatting with deep links
- **Telegram settings UI**: Bot token + chat ID configuration with save/test buttons, test uses saved config when inputs empty
- **Settings accordion**: Collapsible sections for General, Notifications, Tunnel, Telegram, AI, and About
- **Tab overflow indicators**: Color-coded scroll arrows showing most urgent hidden notification type
- **Deep link support**: `?openChat=sessionId` query param to open/focus specific chat tabs
- **Database export/import**: Bulk export/import connections with deduplication, validation, and dropdown menu UI
- **Shared network utility**: Extracted `getLocalIp()` to `src/lib/network-utils.ts`

### Changed
- README simplified with concise quick-start guide

## [0.6.7] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **QuestionCard component**: extracted standalone question UI with tabs, keyboard navigation (arrow keys, 1-9 quick select, Enter submit), custom "Other" input, proper light/dark mode contrast using primary color tokens
- **File browser picker**: consolidated `/api/fs/*` endpoints for command palette filesystem browsing

### Fixed
- **Project restore on reload**: URL project was ignored because effects overwrote the URL before `parseUrlState()` ran; now captures URL in a ref on mount
- **Command palette default order**: AI Chat option moved to top when no query entered
- **Light mode contrast**: QuestionCard replaced `accent` tokens (near-white in light mode) with `primary` for visible borders, selected states, and buttons

## [0.6.6] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Database management sidebar**: full CRUD for SQLite + PostgreSQL connections with color-coded groups, readonly enforcement, CLI commands (`ppm db list/add/remove/test/tables/schema/data/query`)
- **Unified database viewer**: generic `database-viewer.tsx` + `use-database.ts` hook — one viewer for all DB types via adapter pattern, auto-switches SQL dialect (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
- **Connection list tree UI**: dashed tree guide lines for groups and tables, inline table search filter, click-to-expand connections
- **Command palette DB search**: debounced search across cached tables (300ms, 2+ chars)
- **Tab data caching**: sessionStorage cache for instant table data display on page reload, with background refresh
- **Reload button**: toolbar button to force-refresh table data bypassing cache
- **Cached tables API**: `?cached=1` param for instant sidebar table loads without re-querying the database

### Fixed
- **SQLite cell update**: adapter now uses actual PK column instead of hardcoded `rowid`
- **Breadcrumb wrong table**: fixed race condition where `fetchTables` auto-selected first table before `initialTable` jump
- **Auth header missing**: database API calls now use shared `api` client with Bearer token
- **Stale closure in cell update**: `updateCell`/`executeQuery` pass explicit table args to avoid stale React closure
- **Tool card crash**: TodoWrite/AskUserQuestion cards crashed when SDK sent non-array input fields
- **Effort level "max"**: removed unsupported effort level, auto-downgrades to "high" on config load
- **Provider ID mismatch**: fixed stale "claude-sdk" references across routes, hooks, and tests
- **Test suite**: fixed all 19 test failures (isolation, flaky assertions, missing cloudflared skip)

## [0.6.4] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **Login infinite reload**: keybindings API call fired before auth check, causing 401 → token removal → reload loop after SQLite migration
- **ApiClient reload guard**: added sessionStorage-based guard to prevent infinite reload loops from any pre-auth 401 response

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Customizable keyboard shortcuts**: new settings section with click-to-record UI, synced to server (SQLite) across browsers
- **New shortcuts**: Open Chat (`Mod+Shift+L`), Open Terminal (`` Mod+` ``), Open Settings (`Mod+,`), Git Graph (`Mod+Shift+G`), Git Status sidebar (`Mod+Shift+E`), Switch Project 1-9 (`Mod+1..9`)
- Locked shortcuts shown with lock icon, browser-reserved warning banner

### Fixed
- **Chat picker Enter key**: pressing Enter now selects the slash/file picker item instead of also sending the message

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **PostgreSQL viewer**: connect to any PostgreSQL database via connection string, browse tables, edit cells (double-click), run SQL queries with CodeMirror (PostgreSQL dialect), paginated results
- **Command palette**: "PostgreSQL" action to open a new database viewer tab

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **SQLite viewer**: open `.db`/`.sqlite`/`.sqlite3` files in dedicated viewer with table sidebar, TanStack Table data grid (double-click to edit cells), CodeMirror SQL editor, and paginated results
- **SQLite backend API**: `bun:sqlite`-powered endpoints for tables, schema, data, query execution, and cell updates with connection caching and auto-close
- **Tab auto-redirect**: editor tabs for SQLite files automatically switch to the SQLite viewer

### Fixed
- **SQLite viewer**: support absolute file paths (e.g. `~/.ppm/ppm.db`) in addition to project-relative paths

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Storage migration**: migrated all file-based storage (config, sessions, usage) to SQLite

## [0.5.21] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Share: local network URL** — share popover now shows a "Local Network" link (device IP + port) for same-network access, always visible without starting a tunnel
- **Share: separate Cloudflare section** — public tunnel URL shown under "Public (Cloudflare)" label with QR code, only after user clicks "Start Sharing"

## [0.5.20] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Build: relative outDir for Monaco plugin** — use relative `outDir` path (`../../dist/web`) instead of `resolve(__dirname, ...)` to fix Monaco editor worker plugin on Windows builds
- **PWA: increase cache size limit** — set `maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes` to 15MB so large Monaco/worker bundles are cached by the service worker

## [0.5.19] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare tunnel: WS handshake** — FE now sends `{ type: "ready" }` after `onopen`, server responds with status. Through Cloudflare tunnels, the server's `open`-handler message may not arrive because the end-to-end data path isn't fully established when the local WS opens. The roundtrip handshake ensures the path is working before sending connected/status confirmation.

## [0.5.18] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Cloudflare tunnel: WebSocket events not reaching FE** — switch from protocol-level `ws.ping()` to application-level JSON pings (Cloudflare can intercept protocol pings, masking dead connections). Disable `perMessageDeflate` to prevent compressed frame issues through tunnel proxy. Add diagnostic logging to `safeSend` to detect dropped messages.

## [0.5.17] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: resume sessions that exist on disk** — when no explicit mapping but `getSessionMessages()` finds messages, use PPM UUID for `--resume` (session was created with that ID). Prevents losing conversation context when resuming old sessions via CLI fallback

## [0.5.16] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: fix `--resume` with non-existent session** — only pass `--resume` to CLI when a confirmed session mapping exists (from a previous `system/init` event). Previously, failed first messages (ENOENT, TypeError) incremented `messageCount` but never saved a mapping, causing subsequent messages to `--resume` with a PPM UUID the CLI doesn't recognize

## [0.5.15] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: surface CLI errors to frontend** — read all stderr (not just first 500 chars), extract actual error message from end of output, yield as error event so frontend shows real crash reason instead of silent failure

## [0.5.14] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: `claude` .cmd resolution** — `Bun.spawn` can't resolve `.cmd` wrapper scripts (npm globals) directly. Now spawns via `cmd /c claude` so Windows shell resolves PATH correctly

## [0.5.13] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: simulated token streaming** — CLI `stream-json` only emits complete `assistant` messages (no per-token deltas). Now synthesizes `stream_event` / `content_block_delta` events in ~30-char chunks so FE gets smooth typing effect instead of all text appearing at once

## [0.5.12] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: direct CLI fallback for chat** — on Windows, bypass SDK `query()` (broken due to Bun subprocess pipe buffering) and spawn `claude -p --verbose --output-format stream-json` directly. Same event format, same features — streaming, tools, session resume all work
- Removed SDK timeout/diagnostic code (no longer needed with direct CLI fallback)

## [0.5.11] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **SDK 30s timeout with diagnostics** — if SDK query produces no events within 30s, auto-closes the query, runs a direct `claude -p` test, and shows a clear error to the user instead of hanging forever
- **Better error messages** — timeout error suggests using `ppm chat` (terminal) or Node.js as workaround for Bun+Windows SDK issue

## [0.5.10] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **SDK diagnostic logging** — logs `claude --version` output, auth env var status (SET/unset) before each query; helps identify why SDK hangs on Windows

## [0.5.9] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: SDK query hangs silently** — provide fallback `cwd` (home directory) when no project selected; undefined cwd caused SDK subprocess to fail on Windows daemons
- **Better SDK diagnostics** — log claude CLI path check, full error stack on failure; helps debug Windows daemon PATH issues

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: Claude SDK chat not connecting** — stopped unconditionally clearing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var; now only neutralizes keys found in project `.env` files (prevents .env poisoning without breaking API key auth users)
- **Chat connection timeout** — added 120s timeout for SDK first response; shows clear error message instead of spinning forever

### Added
- **Share tunnel from UI** — Share button in project bar starts Cloudflare tunnel with QR code and copy URL
- **Tunnel API** — `GET/POST /api/tunnel` endpoints to check status, start, and stop tunnels

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: PowerShell Start-Process rejects same file for stdout/stderr** — use separate `.err.log` for stderr redirect

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- All CLI commands now print PPM version before execution for easy version verification

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: PowerShell Start-Process fails with empty config arg** — filter empty strings from daemon spawn arguments

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **Windows: daemon process dies when parent exits** — use PowerShell `Start-Process` for truly detached daemon and tunnel processes on Windows
- **Windows: `ppm status -a` / `stop -a` crash** — replaced `pgrep` (Unix-only) with `wmic` on Windows
- Daemon startup now verifies child process is alive after 500ms — shows clear error + suggests `-f` if daemon fails

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `ppm status -a` — list all PPM and cloudflared system processes (tracked + untracked)
- `ppm stop -a` — kill all PPM and cloudflared processes including orphan/zombie ones
- Terminal light theme support — xterm colors follow system/user theme setting
- Git status panel: dropdown actions, `onNavigate` callback for mobile drawer auto-close
- Diff viewer: force inline mode on mobile (<768px), ResizeObserver for dynamic height
- Cross-platform `basename()` utility in `@/lib/utils`

### Fixed
- Panel grid was column-major (`grid[col][row]`) — corrected to row-major (`grid[row][col]`)
- Panel split directions (horizontal adds column within row, vertical adds new row)
- Mobile textarea auto-resize using correct ref (`mobileTextareaRef`)
- Attachment chips moved inside input container for better alignment
- Resize handle thickness reduced (2→1) for cleaner look
- `init` command: use `path.basename()` instead of manual split
- Server daemon spawn: use `path.resolve()` for `import.meta.dir` path join
- Remove leftover SDK debug `console.log` statements

### Changed
- Config service: added diagnostic logging for config search path resolution
- `MAX_ROWS` increased from 2 to 3
- Panel layout orientations swapped: outer=vertical (rows), inner=horizontal (columns)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Context window usage percentage (Ctx:N%) in chat header bar
- SDK rate-limit and cost events write directly to backend cache

### Fixed
- Windows: path separator in project resolution (`/` → `path.sep`)
- Windows: session resume hangs when session not found in SDK history
- Usage detail panel shows "No data" even when badge has data (unified to single REST polling source)

### Changed
- Usage data flows through single backend cache instead of dual WS + REST paths
- Frontend only polls REST endpoint for usage (removed WebSocket mergeUsage path)

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Sidebar tabs auto-hide text when width < 240px (icons only)
- Auto-refresh file tree on window focus (TODO: fs.watch for real-time)
- Drag-and-drop project reorder on desktop, move up/down on mobile
- Test notification button in settings
- Mobile drawer settings tab (replaces history), project sheet settings button works
- Push notification error feedback with 5s timeout on service worker

### Fixed
- Tab bar bottom border alignment with -mb-px overlap
- Close button on toast notifications
- Remove bug report icon from chat toolbar
- Push subscribe infinite loading in dev mode (service worker timeout)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Thinking block**: Stream Claude's extended thinking in collapsible block (auto-collapse when done)
- **Fork/Rewind**: Retry from any user message — forks session, opens new tab with full history
- **Streaming status**: "Thinking... (5s)" with elapsed timer, adaptive warning threshold
- **Command palette "Ask AI"**: No results → Enter sends query to new chat tab
- **Usage auto-polling**: BE fetches every 60s with retry, FE reads cache with `lastFetchedAt` timestamp
- **Mobile bottom sheet**: Command palette as bottom sheet on mobile, + button opens it
- **Scroll to bottom**: Floating button when user scrolls up, auto-stick-to-bottom with use-stick-to-bottom
- **Prompt-kit input**: Rounded container with textarea + action bar, compact on mobile

### Fixed
- WS race condition: entry.ws null during reconnect → all stream events dropped
- Always send `done` from stream loop finally block (prevents infinite spinner)
- Child tool_results from subagent user messages now yielded correctly
- React re-render: new parent object on children update for shallow comparison
- ThinkingIndicator: show only after tool_result, not while tool running
- Settings button opens sidebar tab instead of creating new tab
- 429 rate limit on usage API handled gracefully
- Global BugReportPopup via custom event
