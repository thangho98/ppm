# CLAUDE.md

## Project

PPM (Project & Process Manager) — a web-based IDE/project manager with AI chat powered by Claude Agent SDK.

## Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Backend**: Hono (HTTP) + Bun WebSocket
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- **AI**: @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
- **Tests**: bun:test

## Commands

```bash
bun dev:server    # Start backend dev (port 8081, uses ~/.ppm/ppm.dev.db)
bun dev:web       # Start Vite frontend (port 5173)
bun test          # Run all tests
bun test tests/integration/  # Integration tests only
```

## Dev Config

Config is stored in **SQLite** (`~/.ppm/ppm.db`). Dev uses a separate DB:

- **Dev**: `~/.ppm/ppm.dev.db` — port **8081**
- **Production**: `~/.ppm/ppm.db` — port **8080**

`bun dev:server` automatically uses the dev database. On a new machine, run `ppm init` to create default config, then `ppm config set port 8081` for dev.

## Release Process

1. Commit feature/fix changes
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with all changes
3. Bump version in `package.json` — patch for small changes, minor/major for large ones
4. Commit: `chore: bump version to x.x.x`
5. Publish: `npm publish --access public`

## Quick SDK Tool Test

Use `test-tool.mjs` to verify SDK tool execution against any project cwd:

```bash
bun test-tool.mjs /path/to/project                    # default: echo test
bun test-tool.mjs /path/to/project "dùng thử tool bash"  # custom prompt
```

This uses `ClaudeAgentSdkProvider` directly — same env/settings overrides as production.

## PPM Directory

**Never** use `resolve(homedir(), ".ppm")`, `join(homedir(), ".ppm")`, or `process.env.PPM_HOME || resolve(homedir(), ".ppm")` directly in service code.
Always import `getPpmDir()` from `src/services/ppm-dir.ts`. This ensures test isolation via `PPM_HOME` env var.

Exceptions (intentionally use real `homedir()`):
- `autostart-generator.ts` / `autostart-register.ts` — system service paths (launchd, systemd)
- `claude-usage.service.ts` — reads `~/.claude/` credentials (different dir)
- `fs-browse.service.ts`, `git-dirs.service.ts` — file browser starting from real home
- `ppmbot/` — bot files in real home
- `slash-discovery/` — discovers skills from real home
- `named-tunnel/cloudflared-cert.ts` — `~/.cloudflared` is where `cloudflared` itself writes `cert.pem`, not PPM's directory
- `fs-credential-path-guard.ts` — refuses `~/.cloudflared` (alongside the PPM dir) on every fs read/write/transfer door
- `db-backup/db-backup-paths.ts` — snapshots live in `~/.ppm-backups` *outside* the PPM dir on purpose, so they survive a wipe of it (under an isolated `PPM_HOME` they go back inside that temp dir)

## Known Gotchas

- **SDK .env poisoning**: Projects with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` break SDK tool execution. Provider neutralizes these vars. See `docs/lessons-learned.md`.
- **File watching**: never `fs.watch(dir, { recursive: true })` on a project root — on Linux that is one inotify watch per subdirectory, `node_modules` included (it once cost 359k watches). Ignored dirs must be pruned at registration time via `src/services/file-watcher/watch-tree.ts`.
- **Project Claude settings**: `.claude/settings.local.json` can restrict tools even with `bypassPermissions`. Provider overrides with empty settings.
- **Transcript images live in two places**: the base64 payload sits at `message.content[].content[]` inside a tool result, but Claude Code also writes an image-shaped record at the top-level `toolUseResult` field carrying no payload. An assertion like "no `"type":"image"` remains" must be scoped to the former, or it fails against correct code.
- **Plugin items are named by location, not frontmatter**: Claude Code registers a plugin's skills and commands as `<plugin>:<path>` (`ak-engineer:ak-debug`) and only honours the frontmatter `name` for agents. Kits that self-namespace instead — AgentKit ships `name: ak:debug` — publish a name nothing can resolve. `slash-discovery` mirrors that rule and keeps the declared name as an alias; `src/server/ws/chat.ts` rewrites the alias to the canonical name before the message reaches the SDK.
- **Nested subagents are never streamed**: the SDK stamps `parent_tool_use_id` only on agents the session itself spawned. An agent that spawns another agent (a reviewer running `Skill code-review`, a planner calling researchers) produces **zero** stream events for that grandchild, so the Agent card would freeze on the forking step for minutes. Its transcript still lands in `<session>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, with a meta carrying only `parentAgentId` (raw id, no `agent-` prefix) and no `toolUseId`. `src/services/nested-subagent-spy.ts` tails those during the turn and `subagent-transcript-merger.ts` folds them in flat, time-ordered, on reload — both via `groupSubagentsByCard`, which walks the `parentAgentId` chain to the root card.
- **Agent teams are implicit and mostly not in `~/.claude/teams/`**: there is no `TeamCreate` tool any more. A team appears as `~/.claude/teams/<sessionId>/inboxes/*.json` with **no `config.json`**, so anything that requires a config sees no team at all. The inboxes only hold what was sent *to* each handle — in practice just the lead's task assignments — so they can neither say who is working nor show a teammate's replies. Both live in the agent transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<sessionId>/subagents/`: `agent-<id>.meta.json` maps the teammate `name` to its transcript, a transcript being appended to means that teammate is running, and its replies are `SendMessage` tool calls inside it. See `src/services/team-member-activity/`.

- **An extension panel only gets a tab if a browser tab asked for it**: `use-extension-ws.ts` creates a tab for `webview:create` only when `locallyDispatchedViews` holds a matching entry, i.e. when *this* client dispatched the command. A panel the extension opens on its own initiative exists server-side with no tab to show it. To open one panel from another, call `window.openTab("extension", …, { viewType })` instead — `extension-webview.tsx` then sees a tab with no panel and dispatches the command itself, which *is* a local dispatch. The recovery dispatch forwards only the project path, so any other argument has to be stashed for the target panel to pick up (`packages/ext-git-graph/src/panel-nav.ts`). The command id and the viewType must also be identical: both are turned into a tab slug by stripping a trailing `.view`, and a mismatch silently yields no tab.
- **Extensions may only spawn `git`, `node`, `bun`, `npx`, `sqlite3`** (`ALLOWED_SPAWN_COMMANDS` in `extension-rpc-handlers.ts`) and the call *throws* for anything else. Reaching for `test`, `cat` or any other coreutil looks fine in review and fails only at runtime — where a surrounding `catch` can turn it into silently missing data rather than an error. `env` is merged over `process.env` (so `PATH` survives) except for `BLOCKED_ENV_KEYS`; `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR` and `GIT_EDITOR` are not blocked, which is what makes a non-interactive `git rebase -i` possible.
- **A webview panel has no `prompt`/`confirm`/`alert`**: `extension-webview.tsx` mounts the iframe with `sandbox="allow-scripts"` and nothing else, and a sandboxed `prompt()` returns `null` silently — no exception, no console warning. Any answer a panel needs has to be collected by markup it renders itself (`confirmHtml` in `reflog-view.ts`). The same string is a TypeScript template literal, so a backtick anywhere inside it — a `` `code span` `` in a comment is the usual one — ends the literal early and reports as a syntax error at some unrelated token far below.
- **`vscode.languages` and every editor API are absent for extensions**: no `activeTextEditor`, no `setDecorations`, no hover providers. Anything GitLens-shaped that wants to annotate code has to render its own view in a webview panel.
- **Remote desktop on macOS (avfoundation)**: address the screen by **name** (`-i "Capture screen 0"`), never by index — the device list reorders at runtime when a Continuity Camera joins (index 3 became the iPhone). `-framerate` is ignored (the screen input delivers at display refresh, 120–165 fps, with a stuck pts) → `-use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1` + `-vf fps=30`. ffmpeg-avfoundation ignores SIGTERM/SIGINT → `proc.kill("SIGKILL")` or it leaks one process per session. No Screen Recording grant = **black frames, no error**; no Accessibility grant = silent no-op input — both are pre-flighted in `remote-desktop-requirements.ts`, never inferred from failures. TCC keys the grant to the `bun` executable.
- **Remote desktop text injection on macOS**: `CGEventKeyboardSetUnicodeString` still carries a keycode, and IMEs that hook by key (OpenKey/EVKey) re-read keycode 0 as a literal "a" (`"日本"` → `"â"`); function/unassigned keycodes produce no text at all. The carrier is Space (`TEXT_CARRIER_KEYCODE`). Text is still subject to the host's active IME (Telex rewrote "World" → "ửold") on every OS.

## UI Rules

When creating or modifying any UI component, you MUST read and follow `docs/design-guidelines.md`, especially the **Mobile-First UI Rules** section. Key rules:
- Dialogs → bottom sheet on mobile (below `md:` breakpoint)
- No hover-only interactions — must have touch alternatives
- Touch targets minimum 44×44px
- Context menus → long-press on mobile, not tap
- Thumb zone: primary actions in bottom 1/3 of screen for one-handed use
- Always test both mobile and desktop layouts

### Reusable Adaptive Components

- **Context menus**: Always use `@/components/ui/adaptive-context-menu` instead of `@/components/ui/context-menu`. It auto-detects mobile (< 768px) and renders a bottom sheet with long-press trigger instead of radix right-click menu. Same API — just swap the import path. Sub-menus are flattened inline on mobile.
- **Mobile detection**: Use `useIsMobile()` from `@/hooks/use-is-mobile` for reactive mobile breakpoint checks.

## Roadmap & Context

Before planning or implementing a new feature, read `docs/project-roadmap.md` to understand:
- Which version the feature belongs to (v0.8, v0.9, v0.10, v1.0)
- The theme and scope of that version
- Dependencies between features
- Strategic principles (multi-device focus, extension architecture, tiered providers)

## Architecture

- `src/providers/claude-agent-sdk.ts` — SDK integration, tool execution, streaming
- `src/server/ws/chat.ts` — WebSocket chat handler
- `src/web/hooks/use-chat.ts` — Frontend chat state management
- `src/services/config.service.ts` — Config from SQLite (`~/.ppm/ppm.db`)
- `src/web/components/floating-window/` — Desktop window manager (drag/resize/z-band/persistence), OS-agnostic
- `src/web/components/os-explorer/` — OS File Explorer window body: views (List/Icons/Column), skins, mobile sheet, actions, drag-and-drop
- `src/web/components/settings/` — Settings as its own window kind (`settings-window-content.tsx`) and, below `md` where the window layer does not render, a tab (`settings-tab.tsx`); both mount one `settings-body.tsx`, which picks split-vs-stacked from its OWN width via `@container` — never `useIsMobile()`, because a narrow sidebar is not a phone. Tree in `settings-categories.ts`, id→pane map in `settings-section-content.tsx`, viewport routing in `open-settings.ts` (plain function: the global keybinding handler is not a component). `accounts/` is the single home for account management, one sub-tab per configured provider (Claude + Codex; the tab only shows when that provider is in `ai.providers`). Every provider pane is built from the same parts — `accounts-pane-header.tsx` (header + message strip + `AccountCardShell`) and `account-bucket-row.tsx` (`AccountUsageBar`) — and puts every action behind a dialog, so the sub-tabs cannot drift into different designs again — the chat usage chip and AI Provider’s Codex tab only display and link here. e2e `tests/e2e/settings-window-e2e.mjs`
- `src/services/fs-ops/` — Guarded whole-disk filesystem operations (`/api/fs/*`) behind PPM auth
- `src/services/host-info/` — Per-OS drives/known-folders/pinned-folders providers (`/api/system/host`)
- `src/services/system-metrics/` — Task Manager backend (`/api/system/resources*`): per-OS collectors, one long-lived PowerShell child on Windows (never spawn per tick — 32 MiB commit leak each), light/full SSE tiers with leases, guarded kill. UI in `src/web/components/system/` (floating window on desktop, tab on mobile)
- `src/services/db-backup/` — verified `VACUUM INTO` snapshots of `ppm.db` (hourly + at start + before every migration), GFS retention, `ppm backup` / `ppm restore`
- `src/services/remote-desktop/` — Remote Desktop: one ffmpeg per WS session (`remote-desktop-capture.ts` + per-platform `remote-desktop-capture-input.ts` + `remote-desktop-encoder-args.ts`) → Annex-B H.264 access units → WebCodecs; input via `remote-desktop-input.ts` facade over `remote-desktop-input-{win32,darwin}.ts` (bun:ffi, no helper binary); host checklist in `remote-desktop-requirements.ts` (ffmpeg install command, macOS TCC pre-flight); display list in `remote-desktop-displays.ts` (`CGGetActiveDisplayList` order = avfoundation `Capture screen N`, names/bounds via one JXA call). Routes `src/server/routes/remote-desktop.ts`, WS `src/server/ws/remote-desktop.ts`, UI `src/web/components/remote-desktop/`, e2e `tests/e2e/remote-desktop-e2e.mjs`
- `src/services/git-hunks/` — hunk/line-level stage, unstage and discard (`/api/projects/:name/git/{hunks,stage-hunks,unstage-hunks,discard-hunks}`). `unified-diff.ts` holds the patch surgery (recomputed `@@` counts, unselected deletions demoted to context); the UI is `src/web/components/git/hunk-stage-dialog.tsx`
- `src/services/git-blame/` — `git blame --porcelain` for the editor's inline annotation (`/api/projects/:name/git/blame`); shared shape and formatting in `src/shared/blame.ts`, editor wiring in `src/web/hooks/use-inline-blame.ts`
- `src/services/named-tunnel/` — Named tunnel (stable `https://<prefix>.<zone>` URL via Cloudflare login), orchestrated from `src/server/routes/named-tunnel.ts`, spawned/probed by the supervisor; UI in `src/web/components/tunnels/named-tunnel/`
