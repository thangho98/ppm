/**
 * Every long-press must be disarmed on `touchcancel`, and there is no way to see
 * that it is not.
 *
 * A press that opens a menu is a timer armed on `touchstart` and cleared on
 * `touchmove`/`touchend`, which reads as complete. It is not: once the browser
 * decides the gesture belongs to a scroll it fires **`touchcancel`** and then
 * delivers no further `touchmove` or `touchend` to that element. The timer
 * survives the scroll and fires into it — a context menu over a list the finger
 * is already moving, with nothing the reader did to ask for one. A movement
 * tolerance cannot catch it either, because the moves it would have measured are
 * never delivered.
 *
 * It reproduces on a phone and on nothing else: a mouse has no touch events, and
 * a desktop browser's device emulation dispatches move/end faithfully. So it
 * cannot be caught by a rendered test, and it was live in **six** separate
 * hand-rolled long-presses at once — which is the other half of the problem. The
 * check is therefore on the source: a file that arms a timer from `onTouchStart`
 * has to name `onTouchCancel` too.
