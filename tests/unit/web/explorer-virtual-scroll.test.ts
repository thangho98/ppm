/**
 * The Source Control... no: the *file* explorer's virtual scroller, after the pass
 * that took React off the scroll path.
 *
 * The tree was always virtualized, so "add virtualization" was never the fix. What
 * cost the frames was that `@tanstack/react-virtual` defaults `directDomUpdates`
 * to false, and in that mode every scroll event ends in `flushSync(rerender)` —
 * so the whole mounted row set is reconciled *synchronously inside the scroll
 * handler*. Measured on a 6x-throttled CPU over 1191 rows: 92ms of a 137ms long
 * animation frame was attributed to `DIV.onscroll`, style and layout together 4ms.
 * With the flag on, zero long animation frames.
 *
 * Everything below is asserted against the source rather than a render, because
 * these are four separate settings that only work as a set: turn the flag on but
 * leave the row writing its own `transform` and the two fight; take
 * `measureElement` off and direct updates lose the map they look rows up in
 * (`elementsCache` is populated by that very ref callback). Each one alone reads
 * as correct in review, and the failure is a tree that renders every row at the
 * top of the list.
