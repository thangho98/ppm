/**
 * The Source Control panel's row menus go through the adaptive context menu.
 *
 * Both of them used to be hand-rolled, and each was wrong in its own way. The
 * *file* row paired a private `useLongPress` with a radix `DropdownMenu`: the
 * press was the bug fixed in the `touchcancel` pass, and what it opened was a
 * dropdown — a small popper anchored to a 20px row, with items sized for a
 * mouse. The *folder* row had no press at all; its trigger was the whole row,
 * and a dropdown trigger opens on **tap**, so tapping a folder opened a menu
 * instead of expanding it and there was no way to expand one on a phone.
 *
 * `@/components/ui/adaptive-context-menu` is the project's answer to both (see
 * the UI rules in CLAUDE.md): a bottom sheet with a backdrop and 44px rows on
 * mobile, radix's right-click menu on desktop, one definition for each.
 *
 * Checked on the source because the interesting part is which component is
 * used, and a hand-rolled menu renders perfectly well in a test — it just
 * behaves wrongly under a thumb. Verified in a browser at 390×844: a held press
 * opens the sheet, a press the browser turns into a scroll does not, the click
 * that follows a press is swallowed, a tap opens the diff, and a tap on a
 * folder expands it.
