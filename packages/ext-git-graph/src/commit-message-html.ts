/**
 * A commit message, as HTML, with the links a graph row wants in it.
 *
 * The rule that matters: **every pattern is matched against the raw message,
 * and escaping happens only when the answer is emitted.** The previous version
 * escaped first and matched second, which quietly wrecked messages — the
 * default issue rule is `#(\d+)`, an apostrophe escapes to `&#39;`, and so
 * "Monaco's" was rendered as a literal `&#39;s` with `#39` styled as an issue
 * link. Anything that matches digits, `amp`, `quot` or `lt` would do the same.
 *
 * Matches are collected as spans over the raw text and the first claim on a
 * range wins, in the order URL → issue rule → bare hash. URLs go first so that
 * a `#123` or a hex-looking segment inside one cannot be linked separately and
 * split the URL in half.
 *
 * The function is deliberately self-contained: it is injected into the webview
 * by `toString()`, so it may not reference anything in this module's scope.
 * That is also what lets it be tested here rather than by reading HTML back
 * out of a string.
