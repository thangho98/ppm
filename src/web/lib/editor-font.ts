/**
 * The fonts every code surface uses.
 *
 * A stack has to name a font per platform, because one that lists only
 * `Menlo, Monaco, Consolas` resolves to *none* of them on Linux and silently
 * falls through to generic `monospace` — whatever `fc-match monospace` happens
 * to return, which is not a coding font and is the difference between looking
 * like an editor and looking like a text box.
 *
 * The first entry of each stack is now bundled rather than hoped for
 * (`main.tsx` imports the faces), so the fallbacks below it are only for a face
 * that fails to load. Monaspace's five families share one set of metrics by
 * design, which is what makes it safe to set ghost text in a different one from
 * the code underneath: Monaco positions everything by column times character
 * width, and a family with a different advance would slide out of the grid.
