/**
 * Titlebar button that moves a floating window's body into a Document Picture-in-Picture
 * window and back. Every skin renders it, so every window kind gets the capability — the
 * skin only supplies the box (`className`) that matches its own caption metric.
 *
 * The button is absent, never disabled, where the API is missing (Firefox, Safari, any
 * non-secure context) — a caption button that only ever explains itself is worse than no
 * button at all.
 *
 * Known limitations while a window's body runs in PiP; expected behaviour, not regressions:
 *  - Toasts render in the main window. Sonner mounts one toaster at the app root and it
 *    stays there, so a message raised from the PiP body appears behind it.
 *  - `useIsMobile()` and Tailwind `md:` variants read the MAIN window's viewport, so the
 *    content keeps its desktop layout in a narrow PiP window instead of switching to mobile.
 *  - React's `onSelect`/`selectionchange` is delegated from the document the app root is
 *    mounted in; selection-driven UI degrades for content living in the PiP document.
 *  - `use-terminal`'s reconnect check reads the main document's visibility, so a hidden
 *    main tab is treated as hidden even while its terminal is visible in PiP.
 *  - Monaco chords (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+F, …) do not fire while the editor sits in PiP: typing
 *    reaches the buffer, but the keybinding dispatcher listens on the window the editor was
 *    created in. Undo works again as soon as the body is brought back.
 *  - A tab-host titlebar shows the tab title captured at pop-out time; a tab renamed
 *    afterwards (a chat acquiring a name) keeps the old caption until it is popped out again.
