/**
 * Global event bus WebSocket (`/ws/global`).
 *
 * One connection per browser client, independent of which tabs are open. It owns
 * two things that must not depend on a chat tab being mounted:
 *
 *  1. **Project file watching.** The watcher used to be started by the chat WS, so
 *     it only ran while a chat tab happened to be mounted. Tabs mount lazily now,
 *     so a workspace whose visible tabs are an editor and a terminal would get no
 *     file watching at all — silently breaking editor live-reload, docx/pdf
 *     preview reload, and file-tree invalidation.
 *  2. **Cross-cutting broadcasts** (`file:changed`, `session:unread_changed`,
 *     `session:phase_changed`, `jira:*`). These are app-wide, not session-scoped,
 *     so they belong on an app-wide channel.
 *
 * Events go to global clients only — never also to chat clients — so a client
 * holding both connections cannot receive the same event twice (which would, for
 * example, make an editor re-fetch its file twice per change).
