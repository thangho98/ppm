 * descriptor for it plus one for every file inside — 4 directories holding 600 files
 * come to 604, recursive and non-recursive alike. So a directory cap bounds handles and
 * walk cost, not descriptors; what keeps PPM inside the machine-wide 524288 ceiling is
 * never registering `node_modules` in the first place.
 *
 * The per-project cap is hard. The total is best-effort: a tree keeps growing after
 * it starts, through `syncChildDir` -> `cover`, up to its own `maxDirs` — and on
 * Windows/macOS a recursive handle covers directories created later without telling
 * us either. So projects can add up past the total.
 *
 * A pnpm monorepo runs past 8000 directories on its own — the cap then silently stops
 * watching the rest of the tree, which reads as a file change that never arrives.
 * 12000 covers those with room to spare.
